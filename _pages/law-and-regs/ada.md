    Editor's Note:

    Here is the text of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), including changes made by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. Congress passed the ADA as a “Public Law,” and it originally was in a different format than presented here. To make the law more widely available, the ADA was later reformatted and published in volume 42 (called “title 42”) of the United States Code. One small part of the ADA is found in title 47 of the United States Code. The text below mirrors the law as it is found in the U.S. Code. Because the numbering system is different in the U.S. Code, the headings provide in brackets the title numbers of the ADA as originally enacted.

## Title 42 - The Public Health and Welfare

### Chapter 126 - Equal Opportunity for Individuals with Disabilities

### Sec. 12101. Findings and purpose

<p class="margin-left-4"> <a name="12101a" id="12101a"></a>(a) Findings</p>
<p class="margin-left-4"> The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(1) physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society, yet many people with physical or mental disabilities have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination; others who have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a disability also have been subjected to discrimination; </p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(2) historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem;</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(3) discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services;</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(4) unlike individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or age, individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination;</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(5) individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities;</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(6) census data, national polls, and other studies have documented that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally;</p>

<p class="margin-left-8">(7) the Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals; and</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(8) the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous, and costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity.</p>
<p class="margin-left-4"> <a name="12101b" id="12101b"></a>(b) Purpose</p>
<p class="margin-left-4"> It is the purpose of this chapter—</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(1) to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="margin-left-8"> (2) to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this chapter on behalf of individuals with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(4) to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.</p>

#### Sec. 12101 note: Findings and Purposes of ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-325, §2, Sept. 25, 2008, 122 Stat. 3553, provided that:
<p class="margin-left-4"><a name="12101notea" id="12101notea"></a>(a) Findings</p>

  <p class="margin-left-4">Congress finds that—</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(1) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Congress intended that the Act "provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities" and provide broad coverage;</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(2) in enacting the ADA, Congress recognized that physical and mental disabilities in no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society, but that people with physical or mental disabilities are frequently precluded from doing so because of prejudice, antiquated attitudes, or the failure to remove societal and institutional barriers;</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(3) while Congress expected that the definition of disability under the ADA would be interpreted consistently with how courts had applied the definition of a handicapped individual under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that expectation has not been fulfilled;</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(4) the holdings of the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases have narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many individuals whom Congress intended to protect;</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(5) the holding of the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) further narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA;</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(6) as a result of these Supreme Court cases, lower courts have incorrectly found in individual cases that people with a range of substantially limiting impairments are not people with disabilities;</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(7) in particular, the Supreme Court, in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), interpreted the term "substantially limits" to require a greater degree of limitation than was intended by Congress; and</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(8) Congress finds that the current Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ADA regulations defining the term "substantially limits" as "significantly restricted" are inconsistent with congressional intent, by expressing too high a standard.</p>
  <p class="margin-left-4"><a name="12101noteb" id="12101noteb"></a>(b) Purposes</p>
  <p class="margin-left-4">The purposes of this Act are—</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(1) to carry out the ADA's objectives of providing "a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination" and "clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination" by reinstating a broad scope of protection to be available under the ADA;</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(2) to reject the requirement enunciated by the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases that whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity is to be determined with reference to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures; </p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(3) to reject the Supreme Court's reasoning in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) with regard to coverage under the third prong of the definition of disability and to reinstate the reasoning of the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987) which set forth a broad view of the third prong of the definition of handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(4) to reject the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms "substantially" and "major" in the definition of disability under the ADA "need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled," and that to be substantially limited in performing a major life activity under the ADA "an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives";</p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(5) to convey congressional intent that the standard created by the Supreme Court in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) for "substantially limits", and applied by lower courts in numerous decisions, has created an inappropriately high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ADA, to convey that it is the intent of Congress that the primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations, and to convey that the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis; and </p>
  <p class="margin-left-8">(6) to express Congress' expectation that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will revise that portion of its current regulations that defines the term "substantially limits" as "significantly restricted" to be consistent with this Act, including the amendments made by this Act.</p>

  <p class="margin-left-12">(E)</p>

<p class="margin-left-4">It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this chapter that an alleged application of qualification standards, tests, or selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has been shown to be job- related and consistent with business necessity, and such performance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation, as required under this subchapter.</p>

<p class="margin-left-4"> As used in this section—</p>
<p class="margin-left-8"> (1) Common carrier or carrier</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">The term "common carrier" or "carrier" includes any common carrier engaged in interstate communication by wire or radio as defined in section 153 of this title and any common carrier engaged in intrastate communication by wire or radio, notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="margin-left-8">The term "TDD" means a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf which is a machine that employs graphic communication in the transmission of coded signals through a wire or radio communication system.</p>
<p class="margin-left-8"> (3) Telecommunications relay services</p>

<p class="margin-left-4"> <a name="225b" id="225b"></a>(b) Availability of telecommunications relay service</p>
<p class="margin-left-8"> (1) In general</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">In order to carry out the purposes established under section 151 of this title, to make available to all individuals in the United States a rapid, efficient nationwide communication service, and to increase the utility of the telephone system of the Nation, the Commission shall ensure that interstate and intrastate telecommunications relay services are available, to the extent possible and in the most efficient manner, to hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals in the United States.</p>

<p class="margin-left-8">For the purposes of administering and enforcing the provisions of this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder, the Commission shall have the same authority, power, and functions with respect to common carriers engaged in intrastate communication as the Commission has in administering and enforcing the provisions of this subchapter with respect to any common carrier engaged in interstate communication. Any violation of this section by any common carrier engaged in intrastate communication shall be subject to the same remedies, penalties, and procedures as are applicable to a violation of this chapter by a common carrier engaged in interstate communication.</p>
<p class="margin-left-4"> <a name="225c" id="225c"></a>(c) Provision of services</p>
<p class="margin-left-4"> Each common carrier providing telephone voice transmission services shall, not later than 3 years after July 26, 1990, provide in compliance with the regulations prescribed under this section, throughout the area in which it offers service, telecommunications relay services, individually, through designees, through a competitively selected vendor, or in concert with other carriers. A common carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with such regulations—</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(1) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services in any State that does not have a certified program under subsection (f) of this section and with respect to interstate telecommunications relay services, if such common carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing such relay services) is in compliance with the Commission's regulations under subsection (d) of this section; or</p>
<p class="margin-left-8">(2) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services in any State that has a certified program under subsection (f) of this section for such State, if such common carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing such relay services) is in compliance with the program certified under subsection (f) of this section for such State.</p>

<p class="margin-left-12">(C) require that telecommunications relay services operate every day for 24 hours per day;</p>
<p class="margin-left-12">(D) require that users of telecommunications relay services pay rates no greater than the rates paid for functionally equivalent voice communication services with respect to such factors as the duration of the call, the time of day, and the distance from point of origination to point of termination;</p>
<p class="margin-left-12">(E) prohibit relay operators from failing to fulfill the obligations of common carriers by refusing calls or limiting the length of calls that use telecommunications relay services;</p>
<p class="margin-left-12"> (F) prohibit relay operators from disclosing the content of any relayed conversation and from keeping records of the content of any such conversation beyond the duration of the call; and</p>
<p class="margin-left-12">(G) prohibit relay operators from intentionally altering a relayed conversation.</p>
<p class="margin-left-8"> (2) Technology </p>
