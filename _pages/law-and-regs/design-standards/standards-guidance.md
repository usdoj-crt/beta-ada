## State and Local Government Facilities: Guidance on the Revisions to 28 CFR 35.151

### Guidance on the Revisions to 28 CFR 35.151

Section 35.151(a), which provided that those facilities that are constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, is
  unchanged in the final rule, but has been redesignated as Sec.
  35.151(a)(1). The Department has added a new section, designated as
  Sec.  35.151(a)(2), to provide that full compliance with the
  requirements of this section is not required where an entity can
  demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the
  requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally
  impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique
  characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of
  accessibility features. This exception was contained in the title
  III regulation and in the 1991 Standards (applicable to both public
  accommodations and facilities used by public entities), so it has
  applied to any covered facility that was constructed under the 1991
  Standards since the effective date of the ADA. The Department added
  it to the text of Sec.  35.151 to maintain consistency between the
  design requirements that apply under title II and those that apply
  under title III. The Department received no significant comments
  about this section.

### &sect; 35.151(b) Alterations

The 1991 title II regulation does not contain any specific
  regulatory language comparable to the 1991 title III regulation
  relating to alterations and path of travel for covered entities,
  although the 1991 Standards describe standards for path of travel
  during alterations to a primary function. See 28 CFR part 36, app
  A., section 4.1.6(a) (2009).

The path of travel requirements contained in the title III
  regulation are based on section 303(a)(2) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C.
  12183(a)(2), which provides that when an entity undertakes an
  alteration to a place of public accommodation or commercial facility
  that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area
  that contains a primary function, the entity shall ensure that, to
  the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered
  area--and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving
  it--is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with
  disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.

The NPRM proposed amending Sec.  35.151 to add both the path of
  travel requirements and the exemption relating to barrier removal
  (as modified to apply to the program accessibility standard in title
  II) that are contained in the title III regulation to the title II
  regulation. Proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(4) contained the requirements
  for path of travel. Proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(2) stated that the path
  of travel requirements of Sec.  35.151(b)(4) shall not apply to
  measures taken solely to comply with program accessibility
  requirements.

Where the specific requirements for path of travel apply under
  title III, they are limited to the extent that the cost and scope of
  alterations to the path of travel are disproportionate to the cost
  of the overall alteration, as determined under criteria established
  by the Attorney General.

The Access Board included the path of travel requirement for
  alterations to facilities covered by the standards (other than those
  subject to the residential facilities standards) in section 202.4 of
  2004 ADAAG. Section 35.151(b)(4)(iii) of the final rule establishes
  the criteria for determining when the cost of alterations to the path of travel is &ldquo;disproportionate&rdquo; to the
cost of the overall alteration.

The NPRM also provided that areas such as supply storage rooms,
  employee lounges and locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances,
  and corridors are not areas containing a primary function. Nor are
  restroom areas considered to contain a primary function unless the
  provision of restrooms is a primary purpose of the facility, such as
  at a highway rest stop. In that situation, a restroom would be
  considered to be an &ldquo;area containing a primary function&rdquo; of the
  facility.

The Department is not changing the requirements for program
  accessibility. As provided in Sec.  35.151(b)(2) of the regulation,
  the path of travel requirements of Sec.  35.151(b)(4) only apply to
  alterations undertaken solely for purposes other than to meet the
  program accessibility requirements. The exemption for the specific
  path of travel requirement was included in the regulation to ensure
  that the specific requirements and disproportionality exceptions for
  path of travel are not applied when areas are being altered to meet
  the title II program accessibility requirements in Sec.  35.150. In
  contrast, when areas are being altered to meet program accessibility
  requirements, they must comply with all of the applicable
  requirements referenced in section 202 of the 2010 Standards. A
  covered title II entity must provide accessibility to meet the
  requirements of Sec.  35.150 unless doing so is an undue financial
  and administrative burden in accordance with Sec.  35.150(a)(3). A
  covered title II entity may not use the disproportionality exception
  contained in the path of travel provisions as a defense to providing
  an accessible route as part of its obligation to provide program
  accessibility. The undue financial and administrative burden
  standard does not contain any bright line financial tests.

The Department's proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(4) adopted the
  language now contained in Sec.  36.403 of the title III regulation,
  including the disproportionality limitation (i.e., alterations made
  to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area would be
  deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost
  exceeds 20 percent of the cost of the alteration to the primary
  function area). Proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(2) provided that the path
  of travel requirements do not apply to alterations undertaken solely
  to comply with program accessibility requirements.

The Department received a substantial number of comments
  objecting to the Department's adoption of the exemption for the path
  of travel requirements when alterations are undertaken solely to
  meet program accessibility requirements. These commenters argued
  that the Department had no statutory basis for providing this
  exemption nor does it serve any purpose. In addition, these
  commenters argued that the path of travel exemption has the effect
  of placing new limitations on the obligations to provide program
  access. A number of commenters argued that doing away with the path
  of travel requirement would render meaningless the concept of
  program access. They argued that just as the requirement to provide
  an accessible path of travel to an altered area (regardless of the
  reason for the alteration), including making the restrooms,
  telephones, and drinking fountains that serve the altered area
  accessible, is a necessary requirement in other alterations, it is
  equally necessary for alterations made to provide program access.
  Several commenters expressed concern that a readily accessible path
  of travel be available to ensure that persons with disabilities can
  get to the physical location in which programs are held. Otherwise,
  they will not be able to access the public entity's service,
  program, or activity. Such access is a cornerstone of the
  protections provided by the ADA. Another commenter argued that it
  would be a waste of money to create an accessible facility without
  having a way to get to the primary area. This commenter also stated
  that the International Building Code (IBC) requires the path of
  travel to a primary function area, up to 20 percent of the cost of
  the project. Another commenter opposed the exemption, stating that
  the trigger of an alteration is frequently the only time that a
  facility must update its facilities to comply with evolving
  accessibility standards.

In the Department's view, the commenters objecting to the path
  of travel exemption contained in Sec.  35.151(b)(2) did not
  understand the intention behind the exemption. The exemption was not
  intended to eliminate any existing requirements related to
  accessibility for alterations undertaken in order to meet program
  access obligations under Sec.  35.149 and Sec.  35.150. Rather, it
  was intended to ensure that covered entities did not apply the path
  of travel requirements in lieu of the overarching requirements in
  this Subpart that apply when making a facility accessible in order
  to comply with program accessibility. The exemption was also
  intended to make it clear that the disproportionality test contained
  in the path of travel standards is not applicable in determining
  whether providing program access results in an undue financial and
  administration burden within the meaning of Sec.  35.150(a)(3). The
  exemption was also provided to maintain consistency with the title
  III path of travel exemption for barrier removal, see Sec.
  36.304(d), in keeping with the Department's regulatory authority
  under title II of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. 12134(b); see also H. R
  Rep. No. 101B485, pt. 2, at 84 (1990) (&ldquo;The committee intends,
  however, that the forms of discrimination prohibited by section 202
  be identical to those set out in the applicable provisions of titles
  I and III of this legislation.&rdquo;).

For title II entities, the path of travel requirements are of
  significance in those cases where an alteration is being made solely
  for reasons other than program accessibility. For example, a public
  entity might have six courtrooms in two existing buildings and might
  determine that only three of those courtrooms and the public use and
  common use areas serving those courtrooms in one building are needed
  to be made accessible in order to satisfy its program access
  obligations. When the public entity makes those courtrooms and the
  public use and common use areas serving them accessible in order to
  meet its program access obligations, it will have to comply with the
  2010 Standards unless the public entity can demonstrate that full
  compliance would result in undue financial and administrative
  burdens as described in Sec.  35.150(a)(3). If such action would
  result in an undue financial or administrative burden, the public
  entity would nevertheless be required to take some other action that
  would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would
  ensure that the benefits and services provided by the public entity
  are readily accessible to persons with disabilities. When the public
  entity is making modifications to meet its program access
  obligation, it may not rely on the path of travel exception under
  Sec.  35.151(b)(4), which limits the requirement to those
  alterations where the cost and scope of the alterations are not
  disproportionate to the cost and scope of the overall alterations. If the public entity later decides to alter courtrooms in the other
  building, for purposes of updating the facility (and, as previously
  stated, has met its program access obligations) then in that case,
  the public entity would have to comply with the path of travel
  requirements in the 2010 Standards subject to the disproportionality
  exception set forth in Sec.  35.151(b)(4).

The Department has slightly revised proposed Sec.  35.151(b)(2)
  to make it clearer that the path of travel requirements only apply
  when alterations are undertaken solely for purposes other than
  program accessibility.

#### &sect; 35.151(b)(4)(ii)(C) Path of travel--safe harbor

In Sec.  35.151(b)(4)(ii)(C) of the NPRM, the Department
  included a provision that stated that public entities that have
  brought required elements of path of travel into compliance with the
  1991 Standards are not required to retrofit those elements in order
  to reflect incremental changes in the 2010 Standards solely because
  of an alteration to a primary function area that is served by that
  path of travel. In these circumstances, the public entity is
  entitled to a safe harbor and is only required to modify elements to
  comply with the 2010 Standards if the public entity is planning an
  alteration to the element.

A substantial number of commenters objected to the Department's
  imposition of a safe harbor for alterations to facilities of public
  entities that comply with the 1991 Standards. These commenters
  argued that if a public entity is already in the process of altering
  its facility, there should be a legal requirement that individuals
  with disabilities be entitled to increased accessibility by using
  the 2010 Standards for path of travel work. They also stated that
  they did not believe there was a statutory basis for
  &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo; facilities that comply with the 1991 Standards.

The ADA is silent on the issue of &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo; or
  establishing a safe harbor for measuring compliance in situations
  where the covered entity is not undertaking a planned alteration to
  specific building elements. The ADA delegates to the Attorney
  General the responsibility for issuing regulations that define the
  parameters of covered entities' obligations when the statute does not directly
  address an issue. This regulation implements that delegation of
  authority.

One commenter proposed that a previous record of barrier removal
  be one of the factors in determining, prospectively, what renders a
  facility, when viewed in its entirety, usable and accessible to
  persons with disabilities. Another commenter asked the Department to
  clarify, at a minimum, that to the extent compliance with the 1991
  Standards does not provide program access, particularly with regard
  to areas not specifically addressed in the 1991 Standards, the safe
  harbor will not operate to relieve an entity of its obligations to
  provide program access.

One commenter supported the proposal to add a safe harbor for
  path of travel.

The final rule retains the safe harbor for required elements of
  a path of travel to altered primary function areas for public
  entities that have already complied with the 1991 Standards with
  respect to those required elements. The Department believes that
  this safe harbor strikes an appropriate balance between ensuring
  that individuals with disabilities are provided access to buildings
  and facilities and potential financial burdens on existing public
  entities that are undertaking alterations subject to the 2010
  Standards. This safe harbor is not a blanket exemption for
  facilities. If a public entity undertakes an alteration to a primary
  function area, only the required elements of a path of travel to
  that area that already comply with the 1991 Standards are subject to
  the safe harbor. If a public entity undertakes an alteration to a
  primary function area and the required elements of a path of travel
  to the altered area do not comply with the 1991 Standards, then the
  public entity must bring those elements into compliance with the
  2010 Standards.

#### &sect; 35.151(b)(3) Alterations to historic facilities

The final rule renumbers the requirements for alterations to
  historic facilities enumerated in current Sec.  35.151(d)(1) and (2)
  as Sec.  35.151(b)(3)(i) and (ii). Currently, the regulation
  provides that alterations to historic facilities shall comply to the
  maximum extent feasible with section 4.1.7 of UFAS or section 4.1.7
  of the 1991 Standards. See 28 CFR 35.151(d)(1). Section
  35.151(b)(3)(i) of the final rule eliminates the option of using
  UFAS for alterations that commence on or after March 15, 2012. The
  substantive requirement in current Sec.  35.151(d)(2)--that
  alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the
  requirements of Sec.  35.150 if it is not feasible to provide
  physical access to an historic property in a manner that will not
  threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or
  facility--is contained in Sec.  35.151(b)(3)(ii).

### &sect; 35.151(c) Accessibility standards for new construction and alterations

Section 35.151(c) of the NPRM proposed to adopt ADA Chapter 1,
  ADA Chapter 2, and Chapters 3 through 10 of the Americans with
  Disabilities Act and Architectural Barriers Act Guidelines (2004
  ADAAG) into the ADA Standards for Accessible Design (2010
  Standards). As the Department has noted, the development of these
  standards represents the culmination of a lengthy effort by the
  Access Board to update its guidelines, to make the Federal
  guidelines consistent to the extent permitted by law, and to
  harmonize the Federal requirements with the private sector model
  codes that form the basis of many State and local building code
  requirements. The full text of the 2010 Standards is available for
  public review on the [ADA Home Page](http://www.ada.gov) and on the
  [Access Board's Web site](http://www.access-board.gov/gs.htm) (last
  visited June 24, 2010). The Access Board site also includes an
  extensive discussion of the development of the 2004 ADA/ABA
  Guidelines, and a detailed comparison of the 1991 Standards, the
  2004 ADA/ABA Guidelines, and the 2003 International Building Code.

Section 204 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12134, directs the Attorney
  General to issue regulations to implement title II that are
  consistent with the minimum guidelines published by the Access
  Board. The Attorney General (or his designee) is a statutory member
  of the Access Board (see 29 U.S.C. 792(a)(1)(B(vii)) and was
  involved in the development of the 2004 ADAAG. Nevertheless, during
  the process of drafting the NPRM, the Department reviewed the 2004
  ADAAG to determine if additional regulatory provisions were
  necessary. As a result of this review, the Department decided to
  propose new sections, which were contained in Sec.  35.151(e)-(h) of
  the NPRM, to clarify how the Department will apply the proposed
  standards to social service center establishments, housing at places
  of education, assembly areas, and medical care facilities. Each of
  these provisions is discussed below.

Congress anticipated that there would be a need for close
  coordination of the ADA building requirements with State and local
  building code requirements. Therefore, the ADA authorized the
  Attorney General to establish an ADA code certification process
  under title III of the ADA. That process is addressed in 28 CFR part
  36, subpart F. Revisions to that process are addressed in the
  regulation amending the title III regulation published elsewhere in
  the Federal Register today. In addition, the Department operates an
  extensive technical assistance program. The Department anticipates
  that once this rule is final, revised technical assistance material
  will be issued to provide guidance about its implementation.

Section 35.151(c) of the 1991 title II regulation establishes
  two standards for accessible new construction and alteration. Under
  paragraph (c), design, construction, or alteration of facilities in
  conformance with UFAS or with the 1991 Standards (which, at the time
  of the publication of the rule were also referred to as the
  Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for
  Buildings and Facilities (1991 ADAAG)) is deemed to comply with the
  requirements of this section with respect to those facilities
  (except that if the 1991 Standards are chosen, the elevator
  exemption does not apply). The 1991 Standards were based on the 1991
  ADAAG, which was initially developed by the Access Board as
  guidelines for the accessibility of buildings and facilities that
  are subject to title III. The Department adopted the 1991 ADAAG as
  the standards for places of public accommodation and commercial
  facilities under title III of the ADA and it was published as
  Appendix A to the Department's regulation implementing title III, 56
  FR 35592 (July 26, 1991) as amended, 58 FR 17522 (April 5, 1993),
  and as further amended, 59 FR 2675 (Jan. 18, 1994), codified at 28
  CFR part 36 (2009).

Section 35.151(c) of the final rule adopts the 2010 Standards
  and establishes the compliance date and triggering events for the
  application of those standards to both new construction and
  alterations. Appendix B of the final title III rule (Analysis and
  Commentary on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design) (which
  will be published today elsewhere in this volume and codified as
  Appendix B to 28 CFR part 36) provides a description of the major
  changes in the 2010 Standards (as compared to the 1991 ADAAG) and a
  discussion of the public comments that the Department received on
  specific sections of the 2004 ADAAG. A number of commenters asked
  the Department to revise certain provisions in the 2004 ADAAG in a
  manner that would reduce either the required scoping or specific
  technical accessibility requirements. As previously stated, although
  the ADA requires the enforceable standards issued by the Department
  under title II and title III to be consistent with the minimum
  guidelines published by the Access Board, it is the sole
  responsibility of the Attorney General to promulgate standards and
  to interpret and enforce those standards. The guidelines adopted by
  the Access Board are &ldquo;minimum guidelines.&rdquo; 42 U.S.C. 12186(c).

*Compliance date.* When the ADA was enacted, the effective dates
  for various provisions were delayed in order to provide time for
  covered entities to become familiar with their new obligations.
  Titles II and III of the ADA generally became effective on January
  26, 1992, six months after the regulations were published. See 42
  U.S.C. 12131 note; 42 U.S.C. 12181 note. New construction under
  title II and alterations under either title II or title III had to
  comply with the design standards on that date. See 42 U.S.C.
  12183(a)(1). For new construction under title III, the requirements
  applied to facilities designed and constructed for first occupancy
  after January 26, 1993--18 months after the 1991 Standards were published by the Department. In the NPRM, the Department proposed to
  amend Sec.  35.151(c)(1) by revising the current language to limit
  the application of the 1991 standards to facilities on which
  construction commences within six months of the final rule adopting
  revised standards. The NPRM also proposed adding paragraph (c)(2) to
  Sec.  35.151, which states that facilities on which construction
  commences on or after the date six months following the effective
  date of the final rule shall comply with the proposed standards
  adopted by that rule.

As a result, under the NPRM, for the first six months after the
  effective date, public entities would have the option to use either UFAS or the 1991 Standards and be in compliance with title II. Six
  months after the effective date of the rule, the new standards would
  take effect. At that time, construction in accordance with UFAS
  would no longer satisfy ADA requirements. The Department stated that
  in order to avoid placing the burden of complying with both
  standards on public entities, the Department would coordinate a
  government-wide effort to revise Federal agencies' section 504
  regulations to adopt the 2004 ADAAG as the standard for new
  construction and alterations.

The purpose of the proposed six-month delay in requiring
  compliance with the 2010 Standards was to allow covered entities a
  reasonable grace period to transition between the existing and the
  proposed standards. For that reason, if a title II entity preferred
  to use the 2010 Standards as the standard for new construction or
  alterations commenced within the six-month period after the
  effective date of the final rule, such entity would be considered in
  compliance with title II of the ADA.

The Department received a number of comments about the proposed
  six-month effective date for the title II regulation that were
  similar in content to those received on this issue for the proposed
  title III regulation. Several commenters supported the six-month
  effective date. One commenter stated that any revisions to its State
  building code becomes effective six months after adoption and that
  this has worked well. In addition, this commenter stated that since
  2004 ADAAG is similar to IBC 2006 and ICC/ANSI A117.1-2003, the
  transition should be easy. By contrast, another commenter advocated
  for a minimum 12-month effective date, arguing that a shorter
  effective date could cause substantial economic hardships to many
  cities and towns because of the lengthy lead time necessary for
  construction projects. This commenter was concerned that a six-month
  effective date could lead to projects having to be completely
  redrawn, rebid, and rescheduled to ensure compliance with the new
  standards. Other commenters advocated that the effective date be
  extended to at least 18 months after the publication of the rule.
  One of these commenters expressed concern that the kinds of
  bureaucratic organizations subject to the title II regulations lack
  the internal resources to quickly evaluate the regulatory changes,
  determine whether they are currently compliant with the 1991
  standards, and determine what they have to do to comply with the new
  standards. The other commenter argued that 18 months is the minimum
  amount of time necessary to ensure that projects that have already
  been designed and approved do not have to undergo costly design
  revisions at taxpayer expense.

The Department is persuaded by the concerns raised by commenters
  for both the title II and III regulations that the six-month
  compliance date proposed in the NPRM for application of the 2010
  Standards may be too short for certain projects that are already in
  the midst of the design and permitting process. The Department has
  determined that for new construction and alterations, compliance
  with the 2010 Standards will not be required until 18 months from
  the date the final rule is published. Until the time compliance with
  the 2010 Standards is required, public entities will have the option
  of complying with the 2010 Standards, the UFAS, or the 1991
  Standards. However, public entities that choose to comply with the
  2010 Standards in lieu of the 1991 Standards or UFAS prior to the
  compliance date described in this rule must choose one of the three
  standards, and may not rely on some of the requirements contained in
  one standard and some of the requirements contained in the other
  standards.

*Triggering event.* In Sec.  35.151(c)(2) of the NPRM, the
  Department proposed that the commencement of construction serve as
  the triggering event for applying the proposed standards to new
  construction and alterations under title II. This language is
  consistent with the triggering event set forth in Sec.  35.151(a) of
  the 1991 title II regulation. The Department received only four
  comments on this section of the title II rule. Three commenters
  supported the use of &ldquo;start of construction&rdquo; as the triggering
  event. One commenter argued that the Department should use the
  &ldquo;last building permit or start of physical construction, whichever
  comes first,&rdquo; stating that &ldquo;altering a design after a building
  permit has been issued can be an undue burden.&rdquo;

After considering these comments, the Department has decided to
  continue to use the commencement of physical construction as the
  triggering event for application of the 2010 Standards for entities
  covered by title II. The Department has also added clarifying
  language at Sec.  35.151(c)(4) to the regulation to make it clear
  that the date of ceremonial groundbreaking or the date a structure
  is razed to make it possible for construction of a facility to take
  place does not qualify as the commencement of physical construction.

Section 234 of the 2010 Standards provides accessibility
  guidelines for newly designed and constructed amusement rides. The
  amusement ride provisions do not provide a &ldquo;triggering event&rdquo; for
  new construction or alteration of an amusement ride. An industry
  commenter requested that the triggering event of &ldquo;first use,&rdquo; as
  noted in the Advisory note to section 234.1 of the 2004 ADAAG, be
  included in the final rule. The Advisory note provides that &ldquo;[a]
  custom designed and constructed ride is new upon its first use,
  which is the first time amusement park patrons take the ride.&rdquo; The
  Department declines to treat amusement rides differently than other
  types of new construction and alterations. Under the final rule,
  they are subject to Sec.  35.151(c). Thus, newly constructed and
  altered amusement rides shall comply with the 2010 Standards if the
  start of physical construction or the alteration is on or after 18
  months from the publication date of this rule. The Department also
  notes that section 234.4.2 of the 2010 Standards only applies where
  the structural or operational characteristics of an amusement ride
  are altered. It does not apply in cases where the only change to a
  ride is the theme.

*Noncomplying new construction and alterations.* The element-by-
  element safe harbor referenced in Sec.  35.150(b)(2) has no effect
  on new or altered elements in existing facilities that were subject
  to the 1991 Standards or UFAS on the date that they were constructed
  or altered, but do not comply with the technical and scoping
  specifications for those elements in the 1991 Standards or UFAS.
  Section 35.151(c)(5) of the final rule sets forth the rules for
  noncompliant new construction or alterations in facilities that were
  subject to the requirements of this part. Under those provisions,
  noncomplying new construction and alterations constructed or altered
  after the effective date of the applicable ADA requirements and
  before March 15, 2012 shall, before March 15, 2012, be made
  accessible in accordance with either the 1991 Standards, UFAS, or
  the 2010 Standards. Noncomplying new construction and alterations
  constructed or altered after the effective date of the applicable
  ADA requirements and before March 15, 2012, shall, on or after March
  15, 2012 be made accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards.


#### &sect; 35.151(d) Scope of coverage

In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new provision, Sec.
  35.151(d), to clarify that the requirements established by Sec.
  35.151, including those contained in the 2004 ADAAG, prescribe what
  is necessary to ensure that buildings and facilities, including
  fixed or built-in elements in new or altered facilities, are
  accessible to individuals with disabilities. Once the construction
  or alteration of a facility has been completed, all other aspects of
  programs, services, and activities conducted in that facility are
  subject to the operational requirements established in this final
  rule. Although the Department may use the requirements of the 2010
  Standards as a guide to determining when and how to make equipment
  and furnishings accessible, those determinations fall within the
  discretionary authority of the Department.

The Department also wishes to clarify that the advisory notes,
  appendix notes, and figures that accompany the 1991 and 2010
  Standards do not establish separately enforceable requirements
  unless specifically stated otherwise in the text of the standards.
  This clarification has been made to address concerns expressed by
  ANPRM commenters who mistakenly believed that the advisory notes in
  the 2004 ADAAG established requirements beyond those established in
  the text of the guidelines (e.g., Advisory 504.4 suggests, but does
  not require, that covered entities provide visual contrast on stair
  tread nosing to make them more visible to individuals with low
  vision). The Department received no significant comments on this
  section and it is unchanged in the final rule.

*Definitions of residential facilities and transient lodging.* The
  2010 Standards add a definition of &ldquo;residential dwelling unit&rdquo; and
  modify the current definition of &ldquo;transient lodging.&rdquo; Under
  section 106.5 of the 2010 Standards, &ldquo;residential dwelling unit&rdquo;
  is defined as &ldquo;[a] unit intended to be used as a residence, that is
  primarily long-term in nature&rdquo; and does not include transient
  lodging, inpatient medical care, licensed long-term care, and
  detention or correctional facilities. Additionally, section 106.5 of
  the 2010 Standards changes the definition of &ldquo;transient lodging&rdquo; to a
  building or facility &ldquo;containing one or more guest room(s) for
  sleeping that provides accommodations that are primarily short-term
  in nature.&rdquo; &ldquo;Transient lodging&rdquo; does not include residential
  dwelling units intended to be used as a residence. The references to
  &ldquo;dwelling units&rdquo; and &ldquo;dormitories&rdquo; that are in the definition of
the 1991 Standards are omitted from the 2010 Standards.

The comments about the application of transient lodging or
  residential standards to social service center establishments, and
  housing at a place of education are addressed separately below. The
  Department received one additional comment on this issue from an
  organization representing emergency response personnel seeking an
  exemption from the transient lodging accessibility requirements for
  crew quarters and common use areas serving those crew quarters
  (e.g., locker rooms, exercise rooms, day room) that are used
  exclusively by on-duty emergency response personnel and that are not
  used for any public purpose. The commenter argued that since
  emergency response personnel must meet certain physical
  qualifications that have the effect of exempting persons with
  mobility disabilities, there is no need to build crew quarters and
  common use areas serving those crew quarters to meet the 2004 ADAAG. In addition, the commenter argued that applying the transient
  lodging standards would impose significant costs and create living
  space that is less usable for most emergency response personnel.

The ADA does not exempt spaces because of a belief or policy
  that excludes persons with disabilities from certain work. However,
  the Department believes that crew quarters that are used exclusively
  as a residence by emergency response personnel and the kitchens and
  bathrooms exclusively serving those quarters are more like
  residential dwelling units and are therefore covered by the
  residential dwelling standards in the 2010 Standards, not the
  transient lodging standards. The residential dwelling standards
  address most of the concerns of the commenter. For example, the
  commenter was concerned that sinks in kitchens and lavatories in
  bathrooms that are accessible under the transient lodging standards
  would be too low to be comfortably used by emergency response
  personnel. The residential dwelling standards allow such features to
  be adaptable so that they would not have to be lowered until
  accessibility was needed. Similarly, grab bars and shower seats
  would not have to be installed at the time of construction provided
  that reinforcement has been installed in walls and located so as to
  permit their installation at a later date.

#### &sect; 35.151(e) Social service center establishments

In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new Sec.  35.151(e)
  requiring group homes, halfway houses, shelters, or similar social
  service center establishments that provide temporary sleeping
  accommodations or residential dwelling units to comply with the
  provisions of the 2004 ADAAG that apply to residential facilities,
  including, but not limited to, the provisions in sections 233 and 809.

The NPRM explained that this proposal was based on two important
  changes in the 2004 ADAAG. First, for the first time, residential
  dwelling units are explicitly covered in the 2004 ADAAG in section 233. Second, the 2004 ADAAG eliminates the language contained in the
  1991 Standards addressing scoping and technical requirements for
  homeless shelters, group homes, and similar social service center
  establishments. Currently, such establishments are covered in
  section 9.5 of the transient lodging section of the 1991 Standards.
  The deletion of section 9.5 creates an ambiguity of coverage that
  must be addressed.

The NPRM explained the Department's belief that transferring
  coverage of social service center establishments from the transient
  lodging standards to the residential facilities standards would
  alleviate conflicting requirements for social service center
  providers. The Department believes that a substantial percentage of
  social service center establishments are recipients of Federal
  financial assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban
  Development (HUD). The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
  also provides financial assistance for the operation of shelters
  through the Administration for Children and Families programs. As
  such, these establishments are covered both by the ADA and section
  504 of the Rehabilitation Act. UFAS is currently the design standard
  for new construction and alterations for entities subject to section 504. The two design standards for accessibility--the 1991 Standards
  and UFAS--have confronted many social service providers with
  separate, and sometimes conflicting, requirements for design and
  construction of facilities. To resolve these conflicts, the
  residential facilities standards in the 2004 ADAAG have been
  coordinated with the section 504 requirements. The transient lodging
  standards, however, are not similarly coordinated. The deletion of
  section 9.5 of the 1991 Standards from the 2004 ADAAG presented two
  options: (1) Require coverage under the transient lodging standards,
  and subject such facilities to separate, conflicting requirements
  for design and construction; or (2) require coverage under the
  residential facilities standards, which would harmonize the
  regulatory requirements under the ADA and section 504. The
  Department chose the option that harmonizes the regulatory
  requirements: coverage under the residential facilities standards.

In the NPRM, the Department expressed concern that the
  residential facilities standards do not include a requirement for
  clear floor space next to beds similar to the requirement in the
  transient lodging standards and as a result, the Department proposed
  adding a provision that would require certain social service center
  establishments that provide sleeping rooms with more than 25 beds to
  ensure that a minimum of 5 percent of the beds have clear floor
  space in accordance with section 806.2.3 or 2004 ADAAG.

In the NPRM, the Department requested information from providers
  who operate homeless shelters, transient group homes, halfway
  houses, and other social service center establishments, and from the
  clients of these facilities who would be affected by this proposed
  change, asking, &ldquo;[t]o what extent have conflicts between the ADA
  and section 504 affected these facilities? What would be the effect
  of applying the residential dwelling unit requirements to these
  facilities, rather than the requirements for transient lodging guest
  rooms?&rdquo; 73 FR 34466, 34491 (June 17, 2008).

Many of the commenters supported applying the residential
  facilities requirements to social service center establishments,
  stating that even though the residential facilities requirements are
  less demanding in some instances, the existence of one clear
  standard will result in an overall increased level of accessibility
  by eliminating the confusion and inaction that are sometimes caused
  by the current existence of multiple requirements. One commenter
  also stated that &ldquo;it makes sense to treat social service center
  establishments like residential facilities because this is how these
  establishments function in practice.&rdquo;

Two commenters agreed with applying the residential facilities
  requirements to social service center establishments but recommended
  adding a requirement for various bathing options, such as a roll-in
  shower (which is not required under the residential standards).

One commenter objected to the change and asked the Department to
  require that social service center establishments continue to comply
  with the transient lodging standards.

One commenter stated that it
  did not agree that the standards for residential coverage would
  serve persons with disabilities as well as the 1991 transient
  lodging standards. This commenter expressed concern that the
  Department had eliminated guidance for social service agencies and
  that the rule should be put on hold until those safeguards are
  restored. Another commenter argued that the rule that would provide
  the greatest access for persons with disabilities should prevail.

Several commenters argued for the application of the transient
  lodging standards to all social service center establishments except
  those that were &ldquo;intended as a person's place of abode,&rdquo;
  referencing the Department's question related to the definition of
  &ldquo;place of lodging&rdquo; in the title III NPRM. One commenter stated
  that the International Building Code requires accessible units in
  all transient facilities. The commenter expressed concern that group
  homes should be built to be accessible, rather than adaptable.

The Department continues to be concerned about alleviating the
  challenges for social service providers that are also subject to
  section 504 and would likely be subject to conflicting requirements
  if the transient lodging standards were applied. Thus, the
  Department has retained the requirement that social service center
  establishments comply with the residential dwelling standards. The
  Department believes, however, that social service center
  establishments that provide emergency shelter to large transient
  populations should be able to provide bathing facilities that are
  accessible to persons with mobility disabilities who need roll-in showers. Because
  of the transient nature of the population of these large shelters,
  it will not be feasible to modify bathing facilities in a timely
  manner when faced with a need to provide a roll-in shower with a
  seat when requested by an overnight visitor. As a result, the
  Department has added a requirement that social service center
  establishments with sleeping accommodations for more than 50
  individuals must provide at least one roll-in shower with a seat
  that complies with the relevant provisions of section 608 of the
  2010 Standards. Transfer-type showers are not permitted in lieu of a
  roll-in shower with a seat and the exceptions in sections 608.3 and
  608.4 for residential dwelling units are not permitted. When
  separate shower facilities are provided for men and for women, at
  least one roll-in shower shall be provided for each group. This
  supplemental requirement to the residential facilities standards is
  in addition to the supplemental requirement that was proposed in the
  NPRM for clear floor space in sleeping rooms with more than 25 beds.

The Department also notes that while dwelling units at some
  social service center establishments are also subject to the Fair
  Housing Act (FHAct) design and construction requirements that
  require certain features of adaptable and accessible design, FHAct
  units do not provide the same level of accessibility that is
  required for residential facilities under the 2010 Standards. The
  FHAct requirements, where also applicable, should not be considered
  a substitute for the 2010 Standards. Rather, the 2010 Standards must
  be followed in addition to the FHAct requirements.

The Department also notes that whereas the NPRM used the term
  &ldquo;social service establishment,&rdquo; the final rule uses the term
  &ldquo;social service center establishment.&rdquo; The Department has made
  this editorial change so that the final rule is consistent with the
  terminology used in the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. 12181(7)(k).

#### &sect; 35.151(f) Housing at a place of education

The Department of Justice and the Department of Education share
  responsibility for regulation and enforcement of the ADA in
  postsecondary educational settings, including its requirements for
  architectural features. In addition, the Department of Housing and
  Urban Development (HUD) has enforcement responsibility for housing
  subject to title II of the ADA. Housing facilities in educational
  settings range from traditional residence halls and dormitories to
  apartment or townhouse-style residences. In addition to title II of
  the ADA, public universities and schools that receive Federal
  financial assistance are also subject to section 504, which contains
  its own accessibility requirements through the application of UFAS.
  Residential housing in an educational setting is also covered by the
  FHAct, which requires newly constructed multifamily housing to
  include certain features of accessible and adaptable design. Covered
  entities subject to the ADA must always be aware of, and comply
  with, any other Federal statutes or regulations that govern the
  operation of residential properties.

Although the 1991 Standards mention dormitories as a form of
  transient lodging, they do not specifically address how the ADA
  applies to dormitories or other types of residential housing
  provided in an educational setting. The 1991 Standards also do not
  contain any specific provisions for residential facilities, allowing
  covered entities to elect to follow the residential standards
  contained in UFAS. Although the 2004 ADAAG contains provisions for
  both residential facilities and transient lodging, the guidelines do
  not indicate which requirements apply to housing provided in an
  educational setting, leaving it to the adopting agencies to make
  that choice. After evaluating both sets of standards, the Department
  concluded that the benefits of applying the transient lodging
  standards outweighed the benefits of applying the residential
  facilities standards. Consequently, in the NPRM, the Department
  proposed a new Sec.  35.151(f) that provided that residence halls or
  dormitories operated by or on behalf of places of education shall
  comply with the provisions of the proposed standards for transient
  lodging, including, but not limited to, the provisions in sections
  224 and 806 of the 2004 ADAAG.

Both public and private school housing facilities have varied
  characteristics. College and university housing facilities typically
  provide housing for up to one academic year, but may be closed
  during school vacation periods. In the summer, they are often used
  for short-term stays of one to three days, a week, or several
  months. Graduate and faculty housing is often provided year-round in
  the form of apartments, which may serve individuals or families with
  children. These housing facilities are diverse in their layout. Some
  are double-occupancy rooms with a shared toilet and bathing room,
  which may be inside or outside the unit. Others may contain cluster,
  suite, or group arrangements where several rooms are located inside
  a defined unit with bathing, kitchen, and similar common facilities.
  In some cases, these suites are indistinguishable in features from
  traditional apartments. Universities may build their own housing
  facilities or enter into agreements with private developers to
  build, own, or lease housing to the educational institution or to
  its students. Academic housing may be located on the campus of the
  university or may be located in nearby neighborhoods.

Throughout the school year and the summer, academic housing can
  become program areas in which small groups meet, receptions and
  educational sessions are held, and social activities occur. The
  ability to move between rooms--both accessible rooms and standard
  rooms--in order to socialize, to study, and to use all public use
  and common use areas is an essential part of having access to these
  educational programs and activities. Academic housing is also used
  for short-term transient educational programs during the time
  students are not in regular residence and may be rented out to
  transient visitors in a manner similar to a hotel for special
  university functions.

The Department was concerned that applying the new construction
  requirements for residential facilities to educational housing
  facilities could hinder access to educational programs for students
  with disabilities. Elevators are not generally required under the
  2004 ADAAG residential facilities standards unless they are needed
  to provide an accessible route from accessible units to public use
  and common use areas, while under the 2004 ADAAG as it applies to
  other types of facilities, multistory public facilities must have
  elevators unless they meet very specific exceptions. In addition,
  the residential facilities standards do not require accessible roll-
  in showers in bathrooms, while the transient lodging requirements
  require some of the accessible units to be served by bathrooms with
  roll-in showers. The transient lodging standards also require that a
  greater number of units have accessible features for persons with
  communication disabilities. The transient lodging standards provide
  for installation of the required accessible features so that they
  are available immediately, but the residential facilities standards
  allow for certain features of the unit to be adaptable. For example,
  only reinforcements for grab bars need to be provided in residential
  dwellings, but the actual grab bars must be installed under the
  transient lodging standards. By contrast, the residential facilities
  standards do require certain features that provide greater
  accessibility within units, such as more usable kitchens, and an
  accessible route throughout the dwelling. The residential facilities
  standards also require 5 percent of the units to be accessible to
  persons with mobility disabilities, which is a continuation of the
  same scoping that is currently required under UFAS, and is therefore
  applicable to any educational institution that is covered by section 504. The transient lodging standards require a lower percentage of accessible sleeping rooms for facilities with large numbers of rooms
  than is required by UFAS. For example, if a dormitory had 150 rooms,
  the transient lodging standards would require seven accessible rooms
  while the residential standards would require eight. In a large
  dormitory with 500 rooms, the transient lodging standards would
  require 13 accessible rooms and the residential facilities standards
  would require 25. There are other differences between the two sets
  of standards as well with respect to requirements for accessible
  windows, alterations, kitchens, accessible route throughout a unit,
  and clear floor space in bathrooms allowing for a side transfer.

In the NPRM, the Department requested public comment on how to
  scope educational housing facilities, asking, &ldquo;[w]ould the
  residential facility requirements or the transient lodging
  requirements in the 2004 ADAAG be more appropriate for housing at
  places of education? How would the different requirements affect the
  cost when building new dormitories and other student housing?&rdquo; 73
  FR 34466, 34492 (June 17, 2008).

The vast majority of the comments received by the Department
  advocated using the residential facilities standards for housing at
  a place of education instead of the transient lodging standards,
  arguing that housing at places of public education are in fact homes
  for the students who live in them. These commenters argued, however,
  that the Department should impose a requirement for a variety of options for
  accessible bathing and should ensure that all floors of dormitories
  be accessible so that students with disabilities have the same
  opportunities to participate in the life of the dormitory community
  that are provided to students without disabilities. Commenters
  representing persons with disabilities and several individuals
  argued that, although the transient lodging standards may provide a
  few more accessible features (such as roll-in showers), the
  residential facilities standards would ensure that students with
  disabilities have access to all rooms in their assigned unit, not
  just to the sleeping room, kitchenette, and wet bar. One commenter
  stated that, in its view, the residential facilities standards were
  congruent with overlapping requirements from HUD, and that access
  provided by the residential facilities requirements within
  alterations would ensure dispersion of accessible features more
  effectively. This commenter also argued that while the increased
  number of required accessible units for residential facilities as
  compared to transient lodging may increase the cost of construction
  or alteration, this cost would be offset by a reduced need to adapt
  rooms later if the demand for accessible rooms exceeds the supply.
  The commenter also encouraged the Department to impose a
  visitability (accessible doorways and necessary clear floor space
  for turning radius) requirement for both the residential facilities
  and transient lodging requirements to allow students with mobility
impairments to interact and socialize in a fully integrated fashion.

Two commenters supported the Department's proposed approach. One
  commenter argued that the transient lodging requirements in the 2004
  ADAAG would provide greater accessibility and increase the
  opportunity of students with disabilities to participate fully in
  campus life. A second commenter generally supported the provision of
  accessible dwelling units at places of education, and pointed out
  that the relevant scoping in the International Building Code
  requires accessible units &ldquo;consistent with hotel accommodations.&rdquo;

The Department has considered the comments recommending the use
  of the residential facilities standards and acknowledges that they
  require certain features that are not included in the transient
  lodging standards and that should be required for housing provided
  at a place of education. In addition, the Department notes that
  since educational institutions often use their academic housing
  facilities as short-term transient lodging in the summers, it is
  important that accessible features be installed at the outset. It is
  not realistic to expect that the educational institution will be
  able to adapt a unit in a timely manner in order to provide
  accessible accommodations to someone attending a one-week program
  during the summer.

The Department has determined that the best approach to this
  type of housing is to continue to require the application of
  transient lodging standards, but at the same time to add several
  requirements drawn from the residential facilities standards related
  to accessible turning spaces and work surfaces in kitchens, and the
  accessible route throughout the unit. This will ensure the
  maintenance of the transient lodging standard requirements related
  to access to all floors of the facility, roll-in showers in
  facilities with more than 50 sleeping rooms, and other important
  accessibility features not found in the residential facilities
  standards, but will also ensure usable kitchens and access to all
  the rooms in a suite or apartment.

The Department has added a new definition to Sec.  35.104,
  &ldquo;Housing at a Place of Education,&rdquo; and has revised Sec.  35.151(f)
  to reflect the accessible features that now will be required in
  addition to the requirements set forth under the transient lodging
  standards. The Department also recognizes that some educational
  institutions provide some residential housing on a year-round basis
  to graduate students and staff which is comparable to private rental
  housing, and which contains no facilities for educational
  programming. Section 35.151(f)(3) exempts from the transient lodging
  standards apartments or townhouse facilities provided by or on
  behalf of a place of education that are leased on a year-round basis
  exclusively to graduate students or faculty, and do not contain any
  public use or common use areas available for educational
  programming; instead, such housing shall comply with the
  requirements for residential facilities in sections 233 and 809 of
  the 2010 Standards.

Section 35.151(f) uses the term &ldquo;sleeping room&rdquo; in lieu of the
  term &ldquo;guest room,&rdquo; which is the term used in the transient lodging
  standards. The Department is using this term because it believes
  that, for the most part, it provides a better description of the
  sleeping facilities used in a place of education than &ldquo;guest
  room.&rdquo; The final rule states that the Department intends the terms
  to be used interchangeably in the application of the transient
  lodging standards to housing at a place of education.

#### &sect; 35.151(g) Assembly areas

In the NPRM, the Department proposed Sec.  35.151(g) to
  supplement the assembly area requirements of the 2004 ADAAG, which
  the Department is adopting as part of the 2010 Standards. The NPRM
  proposed at Sec.  35.151(g)(1) to require wheelchair spaces and
  companion seating locations to be dispersed to all levels of the
  facility and are served by an accessible route. The Department
  received no significant comments on this paragraph and has decided
  to adopt the proposed language with minor modifications. The
  Department has retained the substance of this section in the final
  rule but has clarified that the requirement applies to stadiums,
  arenas, and grandstands. In addition, the Department has revised the
  phrase &ldquo;wheelchair and companion seating locations&rdquo; to
  &ldquo;wheelchair spaces and companion seats.&rdquo;

Section 35.151(g)(1) ensures that there is greater dispersion of
  wheelchair spaces and companion seats throughout stadiums, arenas,
  and grandstands than would otherwise be required by sections 221 and
  802 of the 2004 ADAAG. In some cases, the accessible route may not
  be the same route that other individuals use to reach their seats.
  For example, if other patrons reach their seats on the field by an
  inaccessible route (e.g., by stairs), but there is an accessible
  route that complies with section 206.3 of the 2010 Standards that
  could be connected to seats on the field, wheelchair spaces and
  companion seats must be placed on the field even if that route is
  not generally available to the public.

Regulatory language that was included in the 2004 ADAAG
  advisory, but that did not appear in the NPRM, has been added by the
  Department in Sec.  35.151(g)(2). Section 35.151(g)(2) now requires
  an assembly area that has seating encircling, in whole or in part, a
  field of play or performance area such as an arena or stadium, to
  place wheelchair spaces and companion seats around the entire
  facility. This rule, which is designed to prevent a public entity
  from placing wheelchair spaces and companion seats on one side of
  the facility only, is consistent with the Department's enforcement
  practices and reflects its interpretation of section 4.33.3 of the
  1991 Standards.

In the NPRM, the Department proposed Sec.  35.151(g)(2) which
  prohibits wheelchair spaces and companion seating locations from
  being &ldquo;located on, (or obstructed by) temporary platforms or other
  moveable structures.&rdquo; Through its enforcement actions, the
  Department discovered that some venues place wheelchair spaces and
  companion seats on temporary platforms that, when removed, reveal
  conventional seating underneath, or cover the wheelchair spaces and
  companion seats with temporary platforms on top of which they place
  risers of conventional seating. These platforms cover groups of
  conventional seats and are used to provide groups of wheelchair
  seats and companion seats.

Several commenters requested an exception to the prohibition of
  the use of temporary platforms for public entities that sell most of
  their tickets on a season-ticket or other multi-event basis. Such
  commenters argued that they should be able to use temporary
  platforms because they know, in advance, that the patrons sitting in
  certain areas for the whole season do not need wheelchair spaces and
  companion seats. The Department declines to adopt such an exception.
  As it explained in detail in the NPRM, the Department believes that
  permitting the use of movable platforms that seat four or more
  wheelchair users and their companions have the potential to reduce
  the number of available wheelchair seating spaces below the level
  required, thus reducing the opportunities for persons who need
  accessible seating to have the same choice of ticket prices and
  amenities that are available to other patrons in the facility. In
  addition, use of removable platforms may result in instances where
  last minute requests for wheelchair and companion seating cannot be
  met because entire sections of accessible seating will be lost when
  a platform is removed. See 73 FR 34466, 34493 (June 17, 2008).
  Further, use of temporary platforms allows facilities to limit
  persons who need accessible seating to certain seating areas, and to
  relegate accessible seating to less desirable locations. The use of
  temporary platforms has the effect of neutralizing dispersion and other
  seating requirements (e.g., line of sight) for wheelchair spaces and
  companion seats. Cf. Independent Living Resources v. Oregon Arena
  Corp., 1 F. Supp. 2d 1159, 1171 (D. Or. 1998) (holding that while a
  public accommodation may &ldquo;infill&rdquo; wheelchair spaces with removable
  seats when the wheelchair spaces are not needed to accommodate
  individuals with disabilities, under certain circumstances &ldquo;[s]uch
  a practice might well violate the rule that wheelchair spaces must
  be dispersed throughout the arena in a manner that is roughly
  proportionate to the overall distribution of seating&rdquo;). In
  addition, using temporary platforms to convert unsold wheelchair
  spaces to conventional seating undermines the flexibility facilities
  need to accommodate secondary ticket markets exchanges as required
by Sec.  35.138(g) of the final rule.

As the Department explained in the NPRM, however, this provision
  was not designed to prohibit temporary seating that increases
  seating for events (e.g., placing temporary seating on the floor of
  a basketball court for a concert). Consequently, the final rule, at
  Sec.  35.151(g)(3), has been amended to clarify that if an entire
  seating section is on a temporary platform for a particular event,
  then wheelchair spaces and companion seats may be in that seating
  section. However, adding a temporary platform to create wheelchair
  spaces and companion seats that are otherwise dissimilar from nearby
  fixed seating and then simply adding a small number of additional
  seats to the platform would not qualify as an &ldquo;entire seating
  section&rdquo; on the platform. In addition, Sec.  35.151(g)(3) clarifies
  that facilities may fill in wheelchair spaces with removable seats
  when the wheelchair spaces are not needed by persons who use
  wheelchairs.

The Department has been responsive to assembly areas' concerns
  about reduced revenues due to unused accessible seating.
  Accordingly, the Department has reduced scoping requirements
  significantly--by almost half in large assembly areas--and
  determined that allowing assembly areas to infill unsold wheelchair
  spaces with readily removable temporary individual seats
  appropriately balances their economic concerns with the rights of
  individuals with disabilities. See section 221.2 of the 2010
  Standards.

For stadium-style movie theaters, in Sec.  35.151(g)(4) of the
  NPRM the Department proposed requiring placement of wheelchair
  seating spaces and companion seats on a riser or cross-aisle in the
  stadium section of the theater and placement of such seating so that
  it satisfies at least one of the following criteria: (1) It is
  located within the rear 60 percent of the seats provided in the
  auditorium; or (2) it is located within the area of the auditorium
  where the vertical viewing angles are between the 40th to 100th
  percentile of vertical viewing angles for all seats in that theater
  as ranked from the first row (1st percentile) to the back row (100th
  percentile). The vertical viewing angle is the angle between a
  horizontal line perpendicular to the seated viewer's eye to the
  screen and a line from the seated viewer's eye to the top of the
  screen.

The Department proposed this bright-line rule for two reasons:
  (1) The movie theater industry petitioned for such a rule; and (2)
  the Department has acquired expertise on the design of stadium style
  theaters from litigation against several major movie theater chains.
  See U.S. v. AMC Entertainment, 232 F. Supp. 2d 1092 (C.D. Ca. 2002),
  rev'd in part, 549 F. 3d 760 (9th Cir. 2008); U.S. v. Cinemark USA,
  Inc., 348 F. 3d 569 (6th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 542 U.S. 937
  (2004). Two industry commenters--at least one of whom otherwise
  supported this rule--requested that the Department explicitly state
  that this rule does not apply retroactively to existing theaters.
  Although this rule on its face applies to new construction and
  alterations, these commenters were concerned that the rule could be
  interpreted to apply retroactively because of the Department's
  statement in the ANPRM that this bright-line rule, although newly-
  articulated, does not represent a &ldquo;substantive change from the
  existing line-of-sight requirements&rdquo; of section 4.33.3 of the 1991
  Standards. See 69 FR 58768, 58776 (Sept. 30, 2004).

Although the Department intends for Sec.  35.151(g)(4) of this
  rule to apply prospectively to new construction and alterations,
  this rule is not a departure from, and is consistent with, the line-
  of-sight requirements in the 1991 Standards. The Department has
  always interpreted the line-of-sight requirements in the 1991
  Standards to require viewing angles provided to patrons who use
  wheelchairs to be comparable to those afforded to other spectators.
  Section 35.151(g)(4) merely represents the application of these
  requirements to stadium-style movie theaters.

One commenter from a trade association sought clarification
  whether Sec.  35.151(g)(4) applies to stadium-style theaters with
  more than 300 seats, and argued that it should not since dispersion
  requirements apply in those theaters. The Department declines to
  limit this rule to stadium-style theaters with 300 or fewer seats;
  stadium-style theaters of all sizes must comply with this rule. So,
  for example, stadium-style theaters that must vertically disperse
  wheelchair and companion seats must do so within the parameters of
  this rule.

The NPRM included a provision that required assembly areas with
  more than 5,000 seats to provide at least five wheelchair spaces
  with at least three companion seats for each of those five
  wheelchair spaces. The Department agrees with commenters who
  asserted that group seating is better addressed through ticketing
  policies rather than design and has deleted that provision from this
  section of the final rule.

#### &sect; 35.151(h) Medical care facilities

In the 1991 title II regulation, there was no provision
  addressing the dispersion of accessible sleeping rooms in medical
  care facilities. The Department is aware, however, of problems that
  individuals with disabilities face in receiving full and equal
  medical care when accessible sleeping rooms are not adequately
  dispersed. When accessible rooms are not fully dispersed, a person
  with a disability is often placed in an accessible room in an area
  that is not medically appropriate for his or her condition, and is
  thus denied quick access to staff with expertise in that medical
  specialty and specialized equipment. While the Access Board did not
  establish specific design requirements for dispersion in the 2004
  ADAAG, in response to extensive comments in support of dispersion it
  added an advisory note, Advisory 223.1 General, encouraging
  dispersion of accessible rooms within the facility so that
  accessible rooms are more likely to be proximate to appropriate
  qualified staff and resources.

In the NPRM, the Department sought additional comment on the
  issue, asking whether it should require medical care facilities,
  such as hospitals, to disperse their accessible sleeping rooms, and
  if so, by what method (by specialty area, floor, or other criteria).
  All of the comments the Department received on this issue supported
  dispersing accessible sleeping rooms proportionally by specialty
  area. These comments, from individuals, organizations, and a
  building code association, argued that it would not be difficult for
  hospitals to disperse rooms by specialty area, given the high level
  of regulation to which hospitals are subject and the planning that
  hospitals do based on utilization trends. Further, commenters
  suggested that without a requirement, it is unlikely that hospitals
  would disperse the rooms. In addition, concentrating accessible
  rooms in one area perpetuates segregation of individuals with
  disabilities, which is counter to the purpose of the ADA.

The Department has decided to require medical care facilities to
  disperse their accessible sleeping rooms in a manner that is
  proportionate by type of medical specialty. This does not require
  exact mathematical proportionality, which at times would be
  impossible. However, it does require that medical care facilities
  disperse their accessible rooms by medical specialty so that persons
  with disabilities can, to the extent practical, stay in an
  accessible room within the wing or ward that is appropriate for
  their medical needs. The language used in this rule (&ldquo;in a manner
  that is proportionate by type of medical specialty&rdquo;) is more
  specific than that used in the NPRM (&ldquo;in a manner that enables
  patients with disabilities to have access to appropriate specialty
  services&rdquo;) and adopts the concept of proportionality proposed by
  the commenters. Accessible rooms should be dispersed throughout all
  medical specialties, such as obstetrics, orthopedics, pediatrics,
  and cardiac care.

#### &sect; 35.151(i) Curb ramps

Section 35.151(e) on curb ramps in the 1991 rule has been
  redesignated as Sec.  35.151(i). In the NPRM, the Department
  proposed making a minor editorial change to this section, deleting
  the phrase &ldquo;other sloped areas&rdquo; from the two places in which it
  appears in the 1991 title II regulation. In the NPRM, the Department
  stated that the phrase &ldquo;other sloped areas&rdquo; lacks technical
  precision. The Department received no significant public comments on
  this proposal. Upon further consideration, however, the Department
  has concluded that the regulation should acknowledge that there are
  times when there are transitions from sidewalk to road surface that do not technically qualify as &ldquo;curb ramps&rdquo; (sloped surfaces that have a running slope that exceed 5
  percent). Therefore, the Department has decided not to delete the
phrase &ldquo;other sloped areas.&rdquo;

#### &sect; 35.151(j) Residential housing for sale to individual owners

Although public entities that operate residential housing
  programs are subject to title II of the ADA, and therefore must
  provide accessible residential housing, the 1991 Standards did not
  contain scoping or technical standards that specifically applied to
  residential housing units. As a result, under the Department's title
  II regulation, these agencies had the choice of complying with UFAS,
  which contains specific scoping and technical standards for
  residential housing units, or applying the ADAAG transient lodging
  standards to their housing. Neither UFAS nor the 1991 Standards
  distinguish between residential housing provided for rent and those
  provided for sale to individual owners. Thus, under the 1991 title
  II regulation, public entities that construct residential housing
  units to be sold to individual owners must ensure that some of those
  units are accessible. This requirement is in addition to any
  accessibility requirements imposed on housing programs operated by
  public entities that receive Federal financial assistance from
  Federal agencies such as HUD.

The 2010 Standards contain scoping and technical standards for
  residential dwelling units. However, section 233.3.2 of the 2010
  Standards specifically defers to the Department and to HUD, the
  standard-setting agency under the ABA, to decide the appropriate
  scoping for those residential dwelling units built by or on behalf
  of public entities with the intent that the finished units will be
  sold to individual owners. These programs include, for example,
  HUD's public housing and HOME programs as well as State-funded
  programs to construct units for sale to individuals. In the NPRM,
  the Department did not make a specific proposal for this scoping.
  Instead, the Department stated that after consultation and
  coordination with HUD, the Department would make a determination in
  the final rule. The Department also sought public comment on this
  issue stating that &ldquo;[t]he Department would welcome recommendations
  from individuals with disabilities, public housing authorities, and
  other interested parties that have experience with these programs.
  Please comment on the appropriate scoping for residential dwelling
  units built by or on behalf of public entities with the intent that
  the finished units will be sold to individual owners.&rdquo; 73 FR 34466,
  34492 (June 17, 2008).

All of the public comments received by the Department in
  response to this question were supportive of the Department's
  ensuring that the residential standards apply to housing built on
  behalf of public entities with the intent that the finished units
  would be sold to individual owners. The vast majority of commenters
  recommended that the Department require that projects consisting of
  five or more units, whether or not the units are located on one or
  multiple locations, comply with the 2004 ADAAG requirements for
  scoping of residential units, which require that 5 percent, and no
  fewer than one, of the dwelling units provide mobility features, and
  that 2 percent, and no fewer than one, of the dwelling units provide
  communication features. See 2004 ADAAG Section 233.3. These
  commenters argued that the Department should not defer to HUD
  because HUD has not yet adopted the 2004 ADAAG and there is
  ambiguity on the scope of coverage of pre-built for sale units under
  HUD's current section 504 regulations. In addition, these commenters
  expressed concern that HUD's current regulation, 24 CFR 8.29,
  presumes that a prospective buyer is identified before design and
  construction begins so that disability features can be incorporated
  prior to construction. These commenters stated that State and
  Federally funded homeownership programs typically do not identify
  prospective buyers before construction has commenced. One commenter
  stated that, in its experience, when public entities build
  accessible for-sale units, they often sell these units through a
  lottery system that does not make any effort to match persons who
  need the accessible features with the units that have those
  features. Thus, accessible units are often sold to persons without
  disabilities. This commenter encouraged the Department to make sure
  that accessible for-sale units built or funded by public entities
  are placed in a separate lottery restricted to income-eligible
  persons with disabilities.

Two commenters recommended that the Department develop rules for
  four types of for-sale projects: single family pre-built (where
  buyer selects the unit after construction), single family post-built
  (where the buyer chooses the model prior to its construction),
  multi-family pre-built, and multi-family post-built. These
  commenters recommended that the Department require pre-built units
  to comply with the 2004 ADAAG 233.1 scoping requirements. For post-
  built units, the commenters recommended that the Department require
  all models to have an alternate design with mobility features and an
  alternate design with communications features in compliance with
  2004 ADAAG. Accessible models should be available at no extra cost
  to the buyer. One commenter recommended that, in addition to
  required fully accessible units, all ground floor units should be
  readily convertible for accessibility or for sensory impairments
  technology enhancements.

The Department believes that consistent with existing
  requirements under title II, housing programs operated by public
  entities that design and construct or alter residential units for
  sale to individual owners should comply with the 2010 Standards,
  including the requirements for residential facilities in sections
  233 and 809. These requirements will ensure that a minimum of 5
  percent of the units, but no fewer than one unit, of the total
  number of residential dwelling units will be designed and
  constructed to be accessible for persons with mobility disabilities.
  At least 2 percent, but no fewer than one unit, of the total number
  of residential dwelling units shall provide communication features.

The Department recognizes that there are some programs (such as
  the one identified by the commenter), in which units are not
  designed and constructed until an individual buyer is identified. In
  such cases, the public entity is still obligated to comply with the
  2010 Standards. In addition, the public entity must ensure that pre-
  identified buyers with mobility disabilities and visual and hearing
  disabilities are afforded the opportunity to buy the accessible
  units. Once the program has identified buyers who need the number of
  accessible units mandated by the 2010 Standards, it may have to make
  reasonable modifications to its policies, practices, and procedures
  in order to provide accessible units to other buyers with
  disabilities who request such units.

The Department notes that the residential facilities standards
  allow for construction of units with certain features of
  adaptability. Public entities that are concerned that fully
  accessible units are less marketable may choose to build these units
  to include the allowable adaptable features, and then adapt them at
  their own expense for buyers with mobility disabilities who need
  accessible units. For example, features such as grab bars are not
  required but may be added by the public entity if needed by the
  buyer at the time of purchase and cabinets under sinks may be
  designed to be removable to allow access to the required knee space
  for a forward approach.

The Department agrees with the commenters that covered entities
  may have to make reasonable modifications to their policies,
  practices, and procedures in order to ensure that when they offer
  pre-built accessible residential units for sale, the units are
  offered in a manner that gives access to those units to persons with
  disabilities who need the features of the units and who are
  otherwise eligible for the housing program. This may be
  accomplished, for example, by adopting preferences for accessible
  units for persons who need the features of the units, holding
  separate lotteries for accessible units, or other suitable methods
  that result in the sale of accessible units to persons who need the
  features of such units. In addition, the Department believes that
  units designed and constructed or altered that comply with the
  requirements for residential facilities and are offered for sale to
  individuals must be provided at the same price as units without such
  features.

#### &sect; 35.151(k) Detention and correctional facilities

The 1991 Standards did not contain specific accessibility
  standards applicable to cells in correctional facilities. However,
  correctional and detention facilities operated by or on behalf of
  public entities have always been subject to the nondiscrimination
  and program accessibility requirements of title II of the ADA. The
  2004 ADAAG established specific requirements for the design and
  construction and alterations of cells in correctional facilities for
  the first time.

Based on complaints received by the Department, investigations,
  and compliance reviews of jails, prisons, and other detention and
  correctional facilities, the Department has determined that many
  detention and correctional facilities do not have enough accessible cells,
  toilets, and shower facilities to meet the needs of their inmates
  with mobility disabilities and some do not have any at all. Inmates
  are sometimes housed in medical units or infirmaries separate from
  the general population simply because there are no accessible cells.
  In addition, some inmates have alleged that they are housed at a
  more restrictive classification level simply because no accessible
  housing exists at the appropriate classification level. The
  Department's compliance reviews and investigations have
substantiated certain of these allegations.

The Department believes that the insufficient number of
  accessible cells is, in part, due to the fact that most jails and
  prisons were built long before the ADA became law and, since then,
  have undergone few alterations that would trigger the obligation to
  provide accessible features in accordance with UFAS or the 1991
  Standards. In addition, the Department has found that even some new
  correctional facilities lack accessible features. The Department
  believes that the unmet demand for accessible cells is also due to
  the changing demographics of the inmate population. With thousands
  of prisoners serving life sentences without eligibility for parole,
  prisoners are aging, and the prison population of individuals with
  disabilities and elderly individuals is growing. A Bureau of Justice
  Statistics study of State and Federal sentenced inmates (those
  sentenced to more than one year) shows the total estimated count of
  State and Federal prisoners aged 55 and older grew by 36,000 inmates
  from 2000 (44,200) to 2006 (80,200). William J. Sabol et al.,
  Prisoners in 2006, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Dec. 2007,
  at 23 (app. table 7), available at [http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=908](http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=908)  (last visited July 16, 2008); Allen J.  Beck et al., Prisoners in 2000, Bureau of Justice Statistics
  Bulletin, Aug. 2001, at 10 (Aug. 2001) (Table 14), available at
  bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=927 (last visited July
  16, 2008). This jump constitutes an increase of 81 percent in
  prisoners aged 55 and older during this period.

In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new section, Sec.
  35.152, which combined a range of provisions relating to both
  program accessibility and application of the proposed standards to
  detention and correctional facilities. In the final rule, the
  Department is placing those provisions that refer to design,
  construction, and alteration of detention and correction facilities
  in a new paragraph (k) of Sec.  35.151, the section of the rule that
  addresses new construction and alterations for covered entities.
  Those portions of the final rule that address other issues, such as
  placement policies and program accessibility, are placed in the new
  Sec.  35.152.

In the NPRM, the Department also sought input on how best to
  meet the needs of inmates with mobility disabilities in the design,
  construction, and alteration of detention and correctional
  facilities. The Department received a number of comments in response
  to this question.

*New Construction.*  The NPRM did not expressly propose that new
  construction of correctional and detention facilities shall comply
  with the proposed standards because the Department assumed it would
  be clear that the requirements of Sec.  35.151 would apply to new
  construction of correctional and detention facilities in the same
  manner that they apply to other facilities constructed by covered
  entities. The Department has decided to create a new section, Sec.
  35.151(k)(1), which clarifies that new construction of jails,
  prisons, and other detention facilities shall comply with the
  requirements of 2010 Standards. Section 35.151(k)(1) also increases
  the scoping for accessible cells from the 2 percent specified in the
  2004 ADAAG to 3 percent.

*Alterations.* Although the 2010 Standards contain specifications
  for alterations in existing detention and correctional facilities,
  section 232.2 defers to the Attorney General the decision as to the
  extent these requirements will apply to alterations of cells. The
  NPRM proposed at Sec.  35.152(c) that &ldquo;[a]lterations to jails,
  prisons, and other detention and correctional facilities will comply
  with the requirements of Sec.  35.151(b).&rdquo; 73 FR 34466, 34507 (June
  17, 2008). The final rule retains that requirement at Sec.
  35.151(k)(2), but increases the scoping for accessible cells from
  the 2 percent specified in the 2004 ADAAG to 3 percent.

*Substitute cells.* In the ANPRM, the Department sought public
  comment about the most effective means to ensure that existing
  correctional facilities are made accessible to prisoners with
  disabilities and presented three options: (1) Require all altered
  elements to be accessible, which would maintain the current policy
  that applies to other ADA alteration requirements; (2) permit
  substitute cells to be made accessible within the same facility,
  which would permit correctional authorities to meet their obligation
  by providing the required accessible features in cells within the
  same facility, other than those specific cells in which alterations
  are planned; or (3) permit substitute cells to be made accessible
  within a prison system, which would focus on ensuring that prisoners
  with disabilities are housed in facilities that best meet their
  needs, as alterations within a prison environment often result in
  piecemeal accessibility.

In Sec.  35.152(c) of the NPRM, the Department proposed language
  based on Option 2, providing that when cells are altered, a covered
  entity may satisfy its obligation to provide the required number of
  cells with mobility features by providing the required mobility
  features in substitute cells (i.e., cells other than those where
  alterations are originally planned), provided that each substitute
  cell is located within the same facility, is integrated with other
  cells to the maximum extent feasible, and has, at a minimum,
  physical access equal to that of the original cells to areas used by
  inmates or detainees for visitation, dining, recreation, educational
  programs, medical services, work programs, religious services, and
  participation in other programs that the facility offers to inmates
  or detainees.

The Department received few comments on this proposal. The
  majority who chose to comment supported an approach that allowed
  substitute cells to be made accessible within the same facility. In
  their view, such an approach balanced administrators' needs, cost
  considerations, and the needs of inmates with disabilities. One
  commenter noted, however, that with older facilities, required
  modifications may be inordinately costly and technically infeasible.
  A large county jail system supported the proposed approach as the
  most viable option allowing modification or alteration of existing
  cells based on need and providing a flexible approach to provide
  program and mobility accessibility. It noted, as an alternative,
  that permitting substitute cells to be made accessible within a
  prison system would also be a viable option since such an approach
  could create a centralized location for accessibility needs and,
  because that jail system's facilities were in close proximity, it
  would have little impact on families for visitation or on accessible
  programming.

A large State department of corrections objected to the
  Department's proposal. The commenter stated that some very old
  prison buildings have thick walls of concrete and reinforced steel
  that are difficult, if not impossible to retrofit, and to do so
  would be very expensive. This State system approaches accessibility
  by looking at its system as a whole and providing access to programs
  for inmates with disabilities at selected prisons. This commenter
  explained that not all of its facilities offer the same programs or
  the same levels of medical or mental health services. An inmate, for
  example, who needs education, substance abuse treatment, and sex
  offender counseling may be transferred between facilities in order
  to meet his needs. The inmate population is always in flux and there
  are not always beds or program availability for every inmate at his
  security level. This commenter stated that the Department's proposed
  language would put the State in the position of choosing between
  adding accessible cells and modifying paths of travel to programs
  and services at great expense or not altering old facilities,
  causing them to become in states of disrepair and obsolescent, which
  would be fiscally irresponsible.

The Department is persuaded by these comments and has modified
  the alterations requirement in Sec.  35.151(k)(2)(iv) in the final
  rule to allow that if it is technically infeasible to provide
  substitute cells in the same facility, cells can be provided
  elsewhere within the corrections system.

*Number of accessible cells.* Section 232.2.1 of the 2004 ADAAG
  requires at least 2 percent, but no fewer than one, of the cells in
  newly constructed detention and correctional facilities to have
  accessibility features for individuals with mobility disabilities.
  Section 232.3 provides that, where special holding cells or special
  housing cells are provided, at least one cell serving each purpose
  shall have mobility features. The Department sought input on whether
  these 2004 ADAAG requirements are sufficient to meet the needs of
  inmates with mobility disabilities. A major association representing
  county jails throughout the country stated that the 2004 ADAAG 2
  percent requirement for accessible cells is sufficient to meet the
  needs of county jails.

Similarly, a large county sheriff's department advised that the 2
  percent requirement far exceeds the need at its detention facility,
  where the average age of the population is 32. This commenter
  stressed that the regulations need to address the differences
  between a local detention facility with low average lengths of stay
  as opposed to a State prison housing inmates for lengthy periods.
  This commenter asserted that more stringent requirements will raise
  construction costs by requiring modifications that are not needed.
  If more stringent requirements are adopted, the commenter suggested
  that they apply only to State and Federal prisons that house
  prisoners sentenced to long terms. The Department notes that a
  prisoner with a mobility disability needs a cell with mobility
  features regardless of the length of incarceration. However, the
  length of incarceration is most relevant in addressing the needs of
  an aging population.

The overwhelming majority of commenters responded that the 2
  percent ADAAG requirement is inadequate to meet the needs of the
  incarcerated. Many commenters suggested that the requirement be
  expanded to apply to each area, type, use, and class of cells in a
  facility. They asserted that if a facility has separate areas for
  specific programs, such as a dog training program or a substance
  abuse unit, each of these areas should also have 2 percent
  accessible cells but not less than one. These same commenters
  suggested that 5-7 percent of cells should be accessible to meet the
  needs of both an aging population and the larger number of inmates
  with mobility disabilities. One organization recommended that the
  requirement be increased to 5 percent overall, and that at least 2
  percent of each type and use of cell be accessible. Another
  commenter recommended that 10 percent of cells be accessible. An
  organization with extensive corrections experience noted that the
  integration mandate requires a sufficient number and distribution of
  accessible cells so as to provide distribution of locations relevant
  to programs to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to
  the programs.

Through its investigations and compliance reviews, the
  Department has found that in most detention and correctional
  facilities, a 2 percent accessible cell requirement is inadequate to
  meet the needs of the inmate population with disabilities. That
  finding is supported by the majority of the commenters that
  recommended a 5-7 percent requirement. Indeed, the Department itself
  requires more than 2 percent of the cells to be accessible at its
  own corrections facilities. The Federal Bureau of Prisons is subject
  to the requirements of the 2004 ADAAG through the General Services
  Administration's adoption of the 2004 ADAAG as the enforceable
  accessibility standard for Federal facilities under the
  Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. 70 FR 67786, 67846-47 (Nov. 8,
  2005). However, in order to meet the needs of inmates with mobility
  disabilities, the Bureau of Prisons has elected to increase that
  percentage and require that 3 percent of inmate housing at its
  facilities be accessible. Bureau of Prisons, Design Construction
  Branch, Design Guidelines, Attachment A: Accessibility Guidelines
  for Design, Construction, and Alteration of Federal Bureau of
  Prisons (Oct. 31, 2006).

The Department believes that a 3 percent accessible requirement
  is reasonable. Moreover, it does not believe it should impose a
  higher percentage on detention and corrections facilities than it
  utilizes for its own facilities. Thus, the Department has adopted a
  3 percent requirement in Sec.  35.151(k) for both new construction
  and alterations. The Department notes that the 3 percent requirement
  is a minimum. As corrections systems plan for new facilities or
  alterations, the Department urges planners to include numbers of
  inmates with disabilities in their population projections in order
  to take the necessary steps to provide a sufficient number of
  accessible cells to meet inmate needs.

*Dispersion of Cells.* The NPRM did not contain express language
  addressing dispersion of cells in a facility. However, Advisory
  232.2 of the 2004 ADAAG recommends that &ldquo;[a]ccessible cells or
  rooms should be dispersed among different levels of security,
  housing categories, and holding classifications (e.g., male/female
  and adult/juvenile) to facilitate access.&rdquo; In explaining the basis
  for recommending, but not requiring, this type of dispersal, the
  Access Board stated that &ldquo;[m]any detention and correctional
  facilities are designed so that certain areas (e.g., 'shift' areas)
  can be adapted to serve as different types of housing according to
  need&rdquo; and that &ldquo;[p]lacement of accessible cells or rooms in shift
  areas may allow additional flexibility in meeting requirements for
  dispersion of accessible cells or rooms.&rdquo;

The Department notes that inmates are typically housed in
  separate areas of detention and correctional facilities based on a
  number of factors, including their classification level. In many
  instances, detention and correctional facilities have housed inmates
  in inaccessible cells, even though accessible cells were available
  elsewhere in the facility, because there were no cells in the areas
  where they needed to be housed, such as in administrative or
  disciplinary segregation, the women's section of the facility, or in
  a particular security classification area.

The Department received a number of comments stating that
  dispersal of accessible cells together with an adequate number of
  accessible cells is necessary to prevent inmates with disabilities
  from placement in improper security classification and to ensure
  integration. Commenters recommended modification of the scoping
  requirements to require a percentage of accessible cells in each
  program, classification, use or service area. The Department is
  persuaded by these comments. Accordingly, Sec.  35.151(k)(1) and
  (k)(2) of the final rule require accessible cells in each
  classification area.

*Medical facilities.* The NPRM also did not propose language
  addressing the application of the 2004 ADAAG to medical and long-
  term care facilities in correctional and detention facilities. The
  provisions of the 2004 ADAAG contain requirements for licensed
  medical and long-term care facilities, but not those that are
  unlicensed. A disability advocacy group and a number of other
  commenters recommended that the Department expand the application of
  section 232.4 to apply to all such facilities in detention and
  correctional facilities, regardless of licensure. They recommended
  that whenever a correctional facility has a program that is
  addressed specifically in the 2004 ADAAG, such as a long-term care
  facility, the 2004 ADAAG scoping and design features should apply
  for those elements. Similarly, a building code organization noted
  that its percentage requirements for accessible units is based on
  what occurs in the space, not on the building type.

The Department is persuaded by these comments and has added
  Sec.  35.151(k)(3), which states that &ldquo;[w]ith respect to medical
  and long-term care facilities in jails, prisons, and other detention
  and correctional facilities, public entities shall apply the 2010
  Standards technical and scoping requirements for those facilities
  irrespective of whether those facilities are licensed.&rdquo;

## Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities: Guidance on the Revisions to 28 CFR part 36, subpart D

### Guidance on the Revisions to 28 CFR part 36, subpart D

Subpart D establishes the title III requirements applicable to
  new construction and alterations. The Department has amended this
  subpart to adopt the 2004 ADAAG, set forth the effective dates for
  implementation of the 2010 Standards, and make related revisions as
  described below.

#### &sect; 36.403 Alterations: Path of Travel

In the NPRM, the Department proposed one change to Sec.  36.403
  on alterations and path of travel by adding a path of travel safe
  harbor. Proposed Sec.  36.403(a)(1) stated that if a private entity
  has constructed or altered required elements of a path of travel in
  accordance with the 1991 Standards, the private entity is not
  required to retrofit such elements to reflect incremental changes in
  the 2010 Standards solely because of an alteration to a primary
  function area served by that path of travel.

A substantial number of commenters objected to the Department's
  creation of a safe harbor for alterations to required elements of a
  path of travel that comply with the current 1991 Standards. These
  commenters argued that if a public accommodation already is in the
  process of altering its facility, there should be a legal
  requirement that individuals with disabilities are entitled to
  increased accessibility provided by the 2004 ADAAG for path of
  travel work. These commenters also stated that they did not believe
  there was a statutory basis for &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo; facilities that
  comply with the 1991 Standards. Another commenter argued that the
  updates incorporated into the 2004 ADAAG provide very substantial
  improvements for access, and that since there already is a 20
  percent cost limit on the amount that can be expended on path of
  travel alterations, there is no need for a further limitation.

Some commenters supported the safe harbor as lessening the
  economic costs of implementing the 2004 ADAAG for existing
  facilities. One commenter also stated that without the safe harbor,
  entities that already have complied with the 1991 Standards will
  have to make and pay for compliance twice, as compared to those
  entities that made no effort to comply in the first place. Another
  commenter asked that the safe harbor be revised to include pre-ADA
  facilities that have been made compliant with the 1991 Standards to
  the extent &ldquo;readily achievable&rdquo; or, in the case of alterations,
  &ldquo;to the maximum extent feasible,&rdquo; but that are not in full
  compliance with the 1991 Standards.

The final rule retains the safe harbor for required elements of
  a path of travel to altered primary function areas for private
  entities that already have complied with the 1991 Standards with
  respect to those required elements. As discussed with respect to
  Sec.  36.304, the Department believes that this safe harbor strikes
  an appropriate balance between ensuring that individuals with
  disabilities are provided access to buildings and facilities and
  mitigating potential financial burdens on existing places of public
  accommodation that are undertaking alterations subject to the 2010
  Standards. This safe harbor is not a blanket exemption for
  facilities. If a private entity undertakes an alteration to a
  primary function area, only the required elements of a path of
  travel to that area that already comply with the 1991 Standards are
  subject to the safe harbor. If a private entity undertakes an
  alteration to a primary function area and the required elements of a path of travel to the altered area do not comply with the 1991 Standards, then the private entity must bring those
elements into compliance with the 2010 Standards.

#### &sect; 36.405 Alterations: Historic Preservation

In the 1991 rule, the Department provided guidance on making
  alterations to buildings or facilities that are eligible for listing
  in the National Register of Historic Places under the National
  Historic Preservation Act or that are designated as historic under
  State or local law. That provision referenced the 1991 Standards.
  Because those cross-references to the 1991 Standards are no longer
  applicable, it is necessary in this final rule to provide new
  regulatory text. No substantive change in the Department's approach
  in this area is intended by this revision.

#### &sect; 36.406 Standards for New Construction and Alterations

Applicable standards. Section 306 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12186,
  directs the Attorney General to issue regulations to implement title
  III that are consistent with the guidelines published by the Access
  Board. As described in greater detail elsewhere in this Appendix,
  the Department is a statutory member of the Access Board and was
  involved significantly in the development of the 2004 ADAAG.
  Nonetheless, the Department has reviewed the standards and has
  determined that additional regulatory provisions are necessary to
  clarify how the Department will apply the 2010 Standards to places
  of lodging, social service center establishments, housing at a place
  of education, assembly areas, and medical care facilities. Those
  provisions are contained in Sec.  36.406(c)-(g). Each of these
  provisions is discussed below.

Section 36.406(a) adopts the 2004 ADAAG as part of the 2010
  Standards and establishes the compliance date and triggering events
  for the application of those standards to both new construction and
  alterations. Appendix B of this final rule (Analysis and Commentary
  on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design) provides a
  description of the major changes in the 2010 Standards (as compared
  to the 1991 ADAAG) and a discussion of the public comments that the
  Department received on specific sections of the 2004 ADAAG. A number
  of commenters asked the Department to revise certain provisions in
  the 2004 ADAAG in a manner that would reduce either the required
  scoping or specific technical accessibility requirements. As
  previously stated, the ADA requires the Department to adopt
  standards consistent with the guidelines adopted by the Access
  Board. The Department will not adopt any standards that provide less
  accessibility than is provided under the guidelines contained in the
  2004 ADAAG because the guidelines adopted by the Access Board are
  &ldquo;minimum guidelines.&rdquo; 42 U.S.C. 12186(c).

In the NPRM, the Department specifically proposed amending Sec.
  36.406(a) by dividing it into two sections. Proposed Sec.
  36.406(a)(1) specified that new construction and alterations subject
  to this part shall comply with the 1991 Standards if physical
  construction of the property commences less than six months after
  the effective date of the rule. Proposed Sec.  36.406(a)(2)
  specified that new construction and alterations subject to this part
  shall comply with the proposed standards if physical construction of
  the property commences six months or more after the effective date
  of the rule. The Department also proposed deleting the advisory
  information now published in a table at Sec.  36.406(b).

*Compliance date.* When the ADA was enacted, the compliance dates
  for various provisions were delayed in order to provide time for
  covered entities to become familiar with their new obligations.
  Titles II and III of the ADA generally became effective on January
  26, 1992, six months after the regulations were published. See 42
  U.S.C. 12131 note; 42 U.S.C. 12181 note. New construction under
  title II and alterations under either title II or title III had to
  comply with the design standards on that date. See 42 U.S.C. 12131
  note; 42 U.S.C. 12183(a)(2). For new construction under title III,
  the requirements applied to facilities designed and constructed for
  first occupancy after January 26, 1993--18 months after the 1991
  Standards were published by the Department. See 42 U.S.C.
  12183(a)(1).

The Department received numerous comments on the issue of
  effective date, many of them similar to those received in response
  to the ANPRM. A substantial number of commenters advocated a minimum
  of 18 months from publication of the final rule to the effective
  date for application of the standards to new construction,
  consistent with the time period used for implementation of the 1991
  Standards. Many of these commenters argued that the 18-month period
  was necessary to minimize the likelihood of having to redesign
  projects already in the design and permitting stages at the time
  that the final rule is published. According to these commenters,
  large projects take several years from design to occupancy, and can
  be subject to delays from obtaining zoning, site approval, third-
  party design approval (i.e., architectural review), and governmental
  permits. To the extent the new standards necessitate changes in any
  previous submissions or permits already issued, businesses might
  have to expend significant funds and incur delays due to redesign
  and resubmission.

Some commenters also expressed concern that a six-month period
  would be hard to implement given that many renovations are planned
  around retail selling periods, holidays, and other seasonal
  concerns. For example, hotels plan renovations during their slow
  periods, retail establishments avoid renovations during the major
  holiday selling periods, and businesses in certain parts of the
  country cannot do any major construction during parts of the winter.

Some commenters argued that chain establishments need additional
  time to redesign their &ldquo;master facility&rdquo; designs for replication
  at multiple locations, taking into account both the new standards
  and applicable State and local accessibility requirements.

Other commenters argued for extending the effective date from
  six months to a minimum of 12 months for many of the same reasons,
  and one commenter argued that there should be a tolling of the
  effective date for those businesses that are in the midst of the
  permitting process if the necessary permits are delayed due to legal
  challenges or other circumstances outside the business's control.

Several commenters took issue with the Department's
  characterization of the 2004 ADAAG and the 1991 Standards as two
  similar rules. These commenters argued that many provisions in the
  2004 ADAAG represent a &ldquo;substantial and significant&rdquo; departure
  from the 1991 Standards and that it will take a great deal of time
  and money to identify all the changes and implement them. In
  particular, they were concerned that small businesses lacked the
  internal resources to respond quickly to the new changes and that
  they would have to hire outside experts to assist them. One
  commenter expressed concern that regardless of familiarity with the
  2004 ADAAG, since the 2004 ADAAG standards are organized in an
  entirely different manner from the 1991 Standards, and contain, in
  the commenter's view, extensive changes, it will make the shift from
  the old to the new standards quite complicated.

Several commenters also took issue with the Department's
  proffered rationale that by adopting a six-month effective date, the
  Department was following the precedent of other Federal agencies
  that have adopted the 2004 ADAAG for facilities whose accessibility
  they regulate. These commenters argued that the Department's title
  III regulation applies to a much broader range and number of
  facilities and programs than the other Federal agencies (i.e.,
  Department of Transportation and the General Services
  Administration) and that those agencies regulate accessibility
  primarily in either governmental facilities or facilities operated
  by quasi-governmental authorities.

Several commenters representing the travel, vacation, and golf
  industries argued that the Department should adopt a two-year
  effective date for new construction. In addition to many of the
  arguments made by commenters in support of an 18-month effective
  date, these commenters also argued that a two-year time frame would
  allow States with DOJ-certified building codes to have the time to
  amend their codes to meet the 2004 ADAAG so that design
  professionals can work from compatible codes and standards.

Several commenters recommended treating alterations differently
  than new construction, arguing for a one-year effective date for
  alterations. Another commenter representing building officials
  argued that a minimum of a six-month phase-in for alterations was
  sufficient, since a very large percentage of alteration projects
  &ldquo;are of a scale that they should be able to accommodate the phase-
  in.&rdquo;

In contrast, many commenters argued that the proposed six-month
  effective date should be retained in the final rule.

The Department has been persuaded by concerns raised by some of
  the commenters that the six month compliance date proposed in the
  NPRM for application of the 2010 Standards may be too short for
  certain projects that are already in the midst of the design and permitting process. The Department has determined that
  for new construction and alterations, compliance with the 2010
  Standards will not be required until 18 months from the date the
  final rule is published. This is consistent with the amount of time
  given when the 1991 regulation was published. Since many State and
  local building codes contain provisions that are consistent with
  2004 ADAAG, the Department has decided that public accommodations
  that choose to comply with the 2010 Standards as defined in Sec.
  36.104 before the compliance date will still be considered in
  compliance with the ADA. However, public accommodations that choose
  to comply with the 2010 Standards in lieu of the 1991 Standards
  prior to the compliance date described in this rule must choose one
  or the other standard, and may not rely on some of the requirements
  contained in one standard and some of the requirements contained in
the other standard.

*Triggering event.* In the NPRM, the Department proposed using the
  start of physical construction as the triggering event for applying
  the proposed standards to new construction under title III. This
  triggering event parallels that for the alterations provisions
  (i.e., the date on which construction begins), and would apply
  clearly across all types of covered public accommodations. The
  Department also proposed that for prefabricated elements, such as
  modular buildings and amusement park rides and attractions, or
  installed equipment, such as ATMs, the start of construction means
  the date on which the site preparation begins. Site preparation
  includes providing an accessible route to the element.

The Department's NPRM sought public comment on how to define the
  start of construction and the practicality of applying commencement
  of construction as a triggering event. The Department also requested
  input on whether the proposed definition of the start of
  construction was sufficiently clear and inclusive of different types
  of facilities. The Department also sought input about facilities
  subject to title III for which commencement of construction would be
  ambiguous or problematic.

The Department received numerous comments recommending that the
  Department adopt a two-pronged approach to defining the triggering
  event. In those cases where permits are required, the Department
  should use &ldquo;date of permit application&rdquo; as the effective date
  triggering event, and if no permit is required, the Department
  should use &ldquo;start of construction.&rdquo; A number of these commenters
  argued that the date of permit application is appropriate because
  the applicant would have to consider the applicable State and
  Federal accessibility standards in order to submit the designs
  usually required with the application. Moreover, the date of permit
  application is a typical triggering event in other code contexts,
  such as when jurisdictions introduce an updated building code. Some
  commenters expressed concern that using the date of &ldquo;start of
  construction&rdquo; was problematic because the date can be affected by
  factors that are outside the control of the owner. For example, an
  owner can plan construction to start before the new standards take
  effect and therefore use the 1991 Standards in the design. If
  permits are not issued in a timely manner, then the construction
  could be delayed until after the effective date, and then the
  project would have to be redesigned. This problem would be avoided
  if the permit application date was the triggering event. Two
  commenters expressed concern that the term &ldquo;start of construction&rdquo;
  is ambiguous, because it is unclear whether start of construction
  means the razing of structures on the site to make way for a new
  facility or means site preparation, such as regrading or laying the
  foundation.

One commenter recommended using the &ldquo;signing date of a
  construction contract,&rdquo; and an additional commenter recommended
  that the new standards apply only to &ldquo;buildings permitted after the
  effective date of the regulations.&rdquo;

One commenter stated that for facilities that fall outside the
  building permit requirements (ATMs, prefabricated saunas, small
  sheds), the triggering event should be the date of installation,
  rather than the date the space for the facility is constructed.

The Department is persuaded by the comments to adopt a two-
  pronged approach to defining the triggering event for new
  construction and alterations. The final rule states that in those
  cases where permits are required, the triggering event shall be the
  date when the last application for a building permit application or
  permit extension is certified to be complete by a State, county, or
  local government, or in those jurisdictions where the government
  does not certify completion of applications, the date when the last
  application for a building permit or permit extension is received by
  the State, county, or local government. If no permits are required,
  then the triggering event shall be the &ldquo;start of physical
  construction or alterations.&rdquo; The Department has also added
  clarifying language related to the term &ldquo;start of physical
  construction or alterations&rdquo; to make it clear that &ldquo;start of
  physical construction or alterations&rdquo; is not intended to mean the
  date of ceremonial groundbreaking or the date a structure is razed
  to make it possible for construction of a facility to take place.

*Amusement rides.* Section 234 of the 2010 Standards provides
  accessibility guidelines for newly designed and constructed
  amusement rides. The amusement ride provisions do not provide a
  &ldquo;triggering event&rdquo; for new construction or alteration of an
  amusement ride. An industry commenter requested that the triggering
  event of &ldquo;first use&rdquo; as noted in the Advisory note to section
  234.1 of the 2004 ADAAG be included in the final rule. The Advisory
  note provides that &ldquo;[a] custom designed and constructed ride is new
  upon its first use, which is the first time amusement park patrons
  take the ride.&rdquo; The Department declines to treat amusement rides
  differently than other types of new construction and alterations and
  under the final rule, they are subject to Sec.  36.406(a)(3). Thus,
  newly constructed and altered amusement rides shall comply with the
  2010 Standards if the start of physical construction or the
  alteration is on or after 18 months from the publication date of
  this rule. The Department also notes that section 234.4.2 of the
  2010 Standards only applies where the structural or operational
  characteristics of an amusement ride are altered. It does not apply
  in cases where the only change to a ride is the theme.

Noncomplying new construction and alterations. The element-by-
  element safe harbor referenced in Sec.  36.304(d)(2) has no effect
  on new or altered elements in existing facilities that were subject
  to the 1991 Standards on the date that they were constructed or
  altered, but do not comply with the technical and scoping
  specifications for those elements in the 1991 Standards. Section
  36.406(a)(5) of the final rule sets forth the rules for noncompliant
  new construction or alterations in facilities that were subject to
  the requirements of this part. Under those provisions, noncomplying
  new construction and alterations constructed or altered after the
  effective date of the applicable ADA requirements and before March
  15, 2012 shall, before March 15, 2012, be made accessible in
  accordance with either the 1991 Standards or the 2010 Standards. Noncomplying new construction and alterations constructed or altered
  after the effective date of the applicable ADA requirements and
  before March 15, 2012, shall, on or after March 15, 2012, be made
  accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards.

### &sect; 36.406(b) Application of Standards to Fixed Elements

The final rule contains a new Sec.  36.406(b) that clarifies
  that the requirements established by this section, including those
  contained in the 2004 ADAAG, prescribe the requirements necessary to
  ensure that fixed or built-in elements in new or altered facilities
  are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Once the
  construction or alteration of a facility has been completed, all
  other aspects of programs, services, and activities conducted in
  that facility are subject to the operational requirements
  established elsewhere in this final rule. Although the Department
  has often chosen to use the requirements of the 1991 Standards as a
  guide to determining when and how to make equipment and furnishings
  accessible, those coverage determinations fall within the
  discretionary authority of the Department.

The Department is also clarifying that the advisory notes,
  appendix notes, and figures that accompany the 1991 and 2010
  Standards do not establish separately enforceable requirements
  unless otherwise specified in the text of the standards. This
  clarification has been made to address concerns expressed by ANPRM
  commenters who mistakenly believed that the advisory notes in the
  2004 ADAAG established requirements beyond those established in the
  text of the guidelines (e.g., Advisory 504.4 suggests, but does not
  require, that covered entities provide visual contrast on stair
  tread nosings to make them more visible to individuals with low
  vision). The Department received no comments on this provision in
  the NPRM.

### &sect; 36.406(c) Places of Lodging

In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new definition for public
  accommodations that are &ldquo;places of lodging&rdquo; and a new Sec.
  36.406(c) to clarify the scope of coverage for places of public
  accommodation that meet this definition. For many years the
  Department has received inquiries from members of the public seeking
  clarification of ADA coverage of rental accommodations in
  timeshares, condominium hotels, and mixed-use and corporate hotel
  facilities that operate as places of public accommodation (as that
  term is now defined in Sec.  36.104). These facilities, which have
  attributes of both residential dwellings and transient lodging
  facilities, have become increasingly popular since the ADA's
  enactment in 1990 and make up the majority of new hotel construction
  in some vacation destinations. The hybrid residential and lodging
  characteristics of these new types of facilities, as well as their
  ownership characteristics, complicate determinations of ADA
  coverage, prompting questions from both industry and individuals
  with disabilities. While the Department has interpreted the ADA to
  encompass these hotel-like facilities when they are used to provide
  transient lodging, the regulation previously has specifically not
  addressed them. In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new Sec.
  36.406(c), entitled &ldquo;Places of Lodging,&rdquo; which was intended to
  clarify that places of lodging, including certain timeshares,
  condominium hotels, and mixed-use and corporate hotel facilities,
  shall comply with the provisions of the proposed standards,
  including, but not limited to, the requirements for transient
  lodging in sections 224 and 806 of the 2004 ADAAG.

The Department's NPRM sought public input on this proposal. The
  Department received a substantial number of comments on these issues
  from industry representatives, advocates for persons with
  disabilities, and individuals. A significant focus of these comments
  was on how the Department should define and regulate vacation rental
  units in timeshares, vacation communities, and condo-hotels where
  the units are owned and controlled by individual owners and rented
  out some portion of time to the public, as compared to traditional
  hotels and motels that are owned, controlled, and rented to the
  public by one entity.

Scoping and technical requirements applicable to &ldquo;places of
  lodging.&rdquo; In the NPRM, the Department asked for public comment on
  its proposal in Sec.  36.406(c) to apply to places of lodging the
  scoping and technical requirements for transient lodging, rather
  than the scoping and technical requirements for residential dwelling
  units.

Commenters generally agreed that the transient lodging
  requirements should apply to places of lodging. Several commenters
  stated that the determination as to which requirements apply should
  be made based on the intention for use at the time of design and
  construction. According to these commenters, if units are intended
  for transient rentals, then the transient lodging standards should
  apply, and if they are intended to be used for residential purposes,
  the residential standards should apply. Some commenters agreed with
  the application of transient lodging standards to places of lodging
  in general, but disagreed about the characterization of certain
  types of facilities as covered places of lodging.

The Department agrees that the scoping and technical standards
  applicable to transient lodging should apply to facilities that
  contain units that meet the definition of &ldquo;places of lodging.&rdquo;

Scoping for timeshare or condominium hotels. In the NPRM, the
  Department sought comment on the appropriate basis for determining
  scoping for a timeshare or condominium-hotel. A number of commenters
  indicated that scoping should be based on the usage of the facility. Only those units used for short-term stays should be counted for
  application of the transient lodging standards, while units sold as
  residential properties should be treated as residential units not
  subject to the ADA. One commenter stated that scoping should be
  based on the maximum number of sleeping units available for public
  rental. Another commenter pointed out that unlike traditional hotels
  and motels, the number of units available for rental in a facility
  or development containing individually owned units is not fixed over
  time. Owners have the right to participate in a public rental
  program some, all, or none of the time, and individual owner
  participation changes from year to year.

The Department believes that the determination for scoping
  should be based on the number of units in the project that are
  designed and constructed with the intention that their owners may
  participate in a transient lodging rental program. The Department
  cautions that it is not the number of owners that actually exercise
  their right to participate in the program that determines the
  scoping. Rather it is the units that could be placed into an on-site
  or off-site transient lodging rental program. In the final rule, the
  Department has added a provision to Sec.  36.406(c)(3), which states
  that units intended to be used exclusively for residential purposes
  that are contained in facilities that also meet the definition of
  place of lodging are not covered by the transient lodging standards. Title III of the ADA does not apply to units designed and
  constructed with the intention that they be rented or sold as
  exclusively residential units. Such units are covered by the Fair
  Housing Act (FHAct), which contains requirements for certain
  features of accessible and adaptable design both for units and for
  public and common use areas. All units designed and constructed with
  the intention that they may be used for both residential and
  transient lodging purposes are covered by the ADA and must be
  counted for determining the required number of units that must meet
  the transient lodging standards in the 2010 Standards. Public use
  and common use areas in facilities containing units subject to the
  ADA also must meet the 2010 Standards. In some developments, units
  that may serve as residential units some of the time and rental
  units some of the time will have to meet both the FHAct and the ADA
  requirements. For example, all of the units in a vacation
  condominium facility whose owners choose to rent to the public when
  they are not using the units themselves would be counted for the
  purposes of determining the appropriate number of units that must
  comply with the 2010 Standards. In a newly constructed condominium
  that has three floors with units dedicated to be sold solely as
  residential housing and three floors with units that may be used as
  residences or hotel units, only the units on the three latter floors
  would be counted for applying the 2010 Standards. In a newly
  constructed timeshare development containing 100 units, all of which
  may be made available to the public through an exchange or rental
  program, all 100 units would be counted for purposes of applying the
  2010 Standards.

One commenter also asked the Department for clarification of how
  to count individually owned &ldquo;lock-off units.&rdquo; Lock-off units are
  units that are multi-bedroom but can be &ldquo;locked off&rdquo; into two
  separate units, each having individual external access. This
  commenter requested that the Department state in the final rule that
  individually owned lock-off units do not constitute multiple guest
  rooms for purposes of calculating compliance with the scoping
  requirements for accessible units, since for the most part the lock-
  off units are used as part of a larger accessible unit, and portions
  of a unit not locked off would constitute both an accessible one-
  bedroom unit or an accessible two-bedroom unit with the lock-off
  unit.

It is the Department's view that lock-off units that are
  individually owned that can be temporarily converted into two units
  do not constitute two separate guest rooms for purposes of
  calculating compliance with the scoping requirements.

One commenter asked the Department how developers should scope
  units where buildings are constructed in phases over a span of
  years, recommending that the scoping be based on the total number of
  units expected to be constructed at the project and not on a
  building-by-building basis or on a phase-by-phase basis. The
  Department does not think scoping should be based on planned number
  of units, which may or may not be actually constructed over a period
  of years. However, the Department recognizes that resort
  developments may contain buildings and facilities that are of all
  sizes from single-unit cottages to facilities with hundreds of
  units. The Department believes it would be appropriate to allow
  designers, builders, and developers to aggregate the units in
  facilities with 50 or fewer units that are subject to a single
  permit application and that are on a common site or that are
  constructed at the same time for the purposes of applying the
  scoping requirements in table 224.2. Facilities with more than 50
  units should be scoped individually in accordance with the table.
  The regulation has been revised to reflect this application of the
  scoping requirements.

One commenter also asked the Department to use the title III
  regulation to declare that timeshares subject to the transient
  lodging standards are exempt from the design and construction
  requirements of the FHAct. The coverage of the FHAct is set by
  Congress and interpreted by regulations issued by the Department of
  Housing and Urban Development. The Department has no authority to exempt anyone from
coverage of the FHAct.

Application of ADA to places of lodging that contain
  individually owned units. The Department believes that regardless of
  ownership structure for individual units, rental programs (whether
  they are on- or off-site) that make transient lodging guest rooms
  available to the public must comply with the general
  nondiscrimination requirements of the ADA. In addition, as provided
  in Sec.  36.406(c), newly constructed facilities that contain
  accommodations intended to be used for transient lodging purposes
  must comply with the 2010 Standards.

In the NPRM, the Department asked for public comment on several
  issues related to ensuring the availability of accessible units in a
  rental program operated by a place of lodging. The Department sought
  input on how it could address a situation in which a new or
  converted facility constructs the required number of accessible
  units, but the owners of those units choose not to participate in
  the rental program; whether the facility has an obligation to
  encourage or require owners of accessible units to participate in
  the rental program; and whether the facility developer, the
  condominium association, or the hotel operator has an obligation to
  retain ownership or control over a certain number of accessible
  units to avoid this problem.

In the NPRM, the Department sought public input on how to
  regulate scoping for a timeshare or condominium-rental facility that
  decides, after the sale of units to individual owners, to begin a
  rental program that qualifies the facility as a place of lodging,
  and how the condominium association, operator, or developer should
  determine which units to make accessible.

A number of commenters expressed concerns about the ability of
  the Department to require owners of accessible units to participate
  in the rental program, to require developers, condo associations, or
  homeowners associations to retain ownership of accessible units, and
  to impose accessibility requirements on individual owners who choose
  to place inaccessible units into a rental program after purchase. These commenters stated that individuals who purchase accessible vacation units in condominiums, individual vacation homes, and
  timeshares have ownership rights in their units and may choose
  lawfully to make their units available to the public some, all, or
  none of the time. Commenters advised the Department that the
  Securities and Exchange Commission takes the position that if
  condominium units are offered in connection with participation in a
  required rental program for any part of the year, require the use of
  an exclusive rental agent, or impose conditions otherwise
  restricting the occupancy or rental of the unit, then that offering
  will be viewed as an offering of securities in the form of an
  investment (rather than a real estate offering). SEC Release No. 33-
  5347, Guidelines as to the Applicability of the Federal Securities
  Laws to Offers and Sales of Condominiums or Units in a Real Estate
  Development (Jan. 4, 1973). Consequently, most condominium
  developers do not impose such restrictions at the time of sale.
  Moreover, owners who choose to rent their units as a short-term
  vacation rental can select any rental or management company to lease
  and manage their unit, or they may rent them out on their own. They
  also may choose never to lease those units. Thus, there are no
  guarantees that at any particular time, accessible units will be
  available for rental by the public. According to this commenter,
  providing incentives for owners of accessible units to place their
  units in the rental program will not work, because it does not
  guarantee the availability of the requisite number of rooms
  dispersed across the development, and there is not any reasonable,
  identifiable source of funds to cover the costs of such incentives.

A number of commenters also indicated that it potentially is
  discriminatory as well as economically infeasible to require that a
  developer hold back the accessible units so that the units can be
  maintained in the rental program year-round. One commenter pointed
  out that if a developer did not sell the accessible condominiums or
  timeshares in the building inventory, the developer would be subject
  to a potential ADA or FHAct complaint because persons with
  disabilities who wanted to buy accessible units rather than rent
  them each year would not have the option to purchase them. In
  addition, if a developer held back accessible units, the cost of
  those units would have to be spread across all the buyers of the
  inaccessible units, and in many cases would make the project
  financially infeasible. This would be especially true for smaller
  projects. Finally, this commenter argued that requiring units to be
  part of the common elements that are owned by all of the individual
  unit owners is infeasible because the common ownership would result
  in pooled rental income, which would transform the owners into
  participants in a rental pool, and thus turn the sale of the
  condominiums into the sale of securities under SEC Release 33-5347.

Several commenters noted that requiring the operator of the
  rental program to own the accessible units is not feasible either
  because the operator of the rental program would have to have the
  funds to invest in the purchase of all of the accessible units, and
  it would not have a means of recouping its investment. One commenter
  stated that in Texas, it is illegal for on-site rental programs to
  own condominium units. Another commenter noted that such a
  requirement might lead to the loss of on-site rental programs,
  leaving owners to use individual third-party brokers, or rent the
  units privately. One commenter acknowledged that individual owners
  cannot be required to place their units in a rental pool simply to
  offer an accessible unit to the public, since the owners may be
  purchasing units for their own use. However, this commenter
  recommended that owners who choose to place their units in a rental
  pool be required to contribute to a fund that would be used to
  renovate units that are placed in the rental pool to increase the
  availability of accessible units. One commenter argued that the
  legal entity running the place of lodging has an obligation to
  retain control over the required number of accessible units to
  ensure that they are available in accordance with title III.

A number of commenters also argued that the Department has no
  legal authority to require individual owners to engage in barrier
  removal where an existing development adds a rental program. One
  commenter stated that Texas law prohibits the operator of on-site
  rental program from demanding that alterations be made to a
  particular unit. In addition, under Texas law, condominium
  declarations may not require some units and not others to make
  changes, because that would lead to unequal treatment of units and
  owners, which is not permissible.

One commenter stated that since it was not possible for
  operators of rental programs offering privately owned condominiums
  to comply with accessible scoping, the Department should create
  exemptions from the accessible scoping, especially for existing
  facilities. In addition, this commenter stated that if an operator
  of an on-site rental program were to require renovations as a
  condition of participation in the rental program, unit owners might
  just rent their units through a different broker or on their own, in
  which case such requirements would not apply.

A number of commenters argued that if a development decides to
  create a rental program, it must provide accessible units. Otherwise
  the development would have to ensure that units are retrofitted. A
  commenter argued that if an existing building is being converted,
  the Department should require that if alterations of the units are
  performed by an owner or developer prior to sale of the units, then
  the alterations requirements should apply, in order to ensure that
  there are some accessible units in the rental pool. This commenter
  stated that because of the proliferation of these type of
  developments in Hawaii, mandatory alteration is the only way to
  guarantee the availability of accessible units in the long run. In
  this commenter's view, since conversions almost always require
  makeover of existing buildings, this will not lead to a significant
  expense.

The Department agrees with the commenters that it would not be
  feasible to require developers to hold back or purchase accessible
  units for the purposes of making them available to the public in a
  transient lodging rental program, nor would it be feasible to
  require individual owners of accessible units to participate in
  transient lodging rental programs.

The Department recognizes that places of lodging are developed
  and financed under myriad ownership and management structures and
  agrees that there will be circumstances where there are legal
  barriers to requiring compliance with either the alterations
  requirements or the requirements related to barrier removal. The
  Department has added an exception to Sec.  36.406(c), providing that
  in existing facilities that meet the definition of places of
  lodging, where the guest rooms are not owned or substantially
  controlled by the entity that owns, leases, or operates the overall
  facility and the physical features of the guest room interiors are
  controlled by their individual owners, the units are not subject to
  the alterations requirement, even where the owner rents the unit out to the public through a transient lodging rental program.

In addition, the Department has added an exception to the barrier
  removal requirements at Sec.  36.304(g) providing that in existing
  facilities that meet the definition of places of lodging, where the
  guest rooms are not owned or substantially controlled by the entity
  that owns, leases, or operates the overall facility and the physical
  features of the guest room interiors are controlled by their
  individual owners, the units are not subject to the barrier removal
  requirement. The Department notes, however, that there are legal
  relationships for some timeshares and cooperatives where the
  ownership interests do not convey control over the physical features
  of units. In those cases, it may be the case that the facility has
  an obligation to meet the alterations or barrier removal
requirements or to maintain accessible features.

### &sect; 36.406(d) Social Service Center Establishments

In the NPRM, the Department proposed a new Sec.  36.406(d)
  requiring group homes, halfway houses, shelters, or similar social
  service center establishments that provide temporary sleeping
  accommodations or residential dwelling units to comply with the
  provisions of the 2004 ADAAG that apply to residential facilities,
  including, but not limited to, the provisions in sections 233 and 809.

The NPRM explained that this proposal was based on two important
  changes in the 2004 ADAAG. First, for the first time, residential
  dwelling units are explicitly covered in the 2004 ADAAG in section 233. Second, the 2004 ADAAG eliminates the language contained in the
  1991 Standards addressing scoping and technical requirements for
  homeless shelters, group homes, and similar social service center
  establishments. Currently, such establishments are covered in
  section 9.5 of the transient lodging section of the 1991 Standards.
  The deletion of section 9.5 creates an ambiguity of coverage that
  must be addressed.

The NPRM explained the Department's belief that transferring
  coverage of social service center establishments from the transient
  lodging standards to the residential facilities standards would
  alleviate conflicting requirements for social service providers. The
  Department believes that a substantial percentage of social service
  providers are recipients of Federal financial assistance from the
  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Department of
  Health and Human Services (HHS) also provides financial assistance
  for the operation of shelters through the Administration for
  Children and Families programs. As such, they are covered both by
  the ADA and section 504. UFAS is currently the design standard for
  new construction and alterations for entities subject to section 504. The two design standards for accessibility--the 1991 Standards
  and UFAS--have confronted many social service providers with
  separate, and sometimes conflicting, requirements for design and
  construction of facilities. To resolve these conflicts, the
  residential facilities standards in the 2004 ADAAG have been
  coordinated with the section 504 requirements. The transient lodging
  standards, however, are not similarly coordinated. The deletion of
  section 9.5 of the 1991 Standards from the 2004 ADAAG presented two
  options: (1) Require coverage under the transient lodging standards,
  and subject such facilities to separate, conflicting requirements
  for design and construction; or (2) require coverage under the
  residential facilities standards, which would harmonizes the
  regulatory requirements under the ADA and section 504. The
  Department chose the option that harmonizes the regulatory
  requirements: coverage under the residential facilities standards.

In the NPRM, the Department expressed concern that the
  residential facilities standards do not include a requirement for
  clear floor space next to beds similar to the requirement in the
  transient lodging standards; as a result, the Department proposed
  adding a provision that would require certain social service center
  establishments that provide sleeping rooms with more than 25 beds to
  ensure that a minimum of 5 percent of the beds have clear floor
  space in accordance with section 806.2.3 of the 2004 ADAAG.

The Department requested information from providers who operate
  homeless shelters, transient group homes, halfway houses, and other
  social service center establishments, and from the clients of these
  facilities who would be affected by this proposed change. In the
  NPRM, the Department asked to what extent conflicts between the ADA
  and section 504 have affected these facilities and what the effect
  would be of applying the residential dwelling unit requirements to
  these facilities, rather than the requirements for transient lodging
  guest rooms.

Many of the commenters supported applying the residential
  facilities requirements to social service center establishments
  stating that even though the residential facilities requirements are
  less demanding, in some instances, the existence of one clear
  standard will result in an overall increased level of accessibility
  by eliminating the confusion and inaction that are sometimes caused
  by the current existence of multiple requirements. One commenter
  stated that the residential facilities guidelines were more
  appropriate because individuals housed in social service center
  establishments typically stay for a prolonged period of time, and
  guests of a transient lodging facility typically are not housed to
  participate in a program or receive services.

One commenter opposed to the proposed section argued for the
  application of the transient lodging standards to all social service
  center establishments except those that were &ldquo;intended as a
  person's place of abode,&rdquo; referencing the Department's question
  related to the definition of place of lodging in the title III NPRM.
  A second commenter stated that the use of transient lodging
  guidelines would lead to greater accessibility.

The Department continues to be concerned about alleviating the
  challenges for social service providers that are also subject to
  section 504 and that would likely be subject to conflicting
  requirements if the transient lodging standard were applied. Thus,
  the Department has retained the requirement that social service
  center establishments comply with the residential dwelling
  standards. The Department did not receive comments regarding adding
  a requirement for bathing options, such as a roll-in shower, in
  social service center establishments operated by public
  accommodations. The Department did, however, receive comments in
  support of adding such a requirement regarding public entities under
  title II. The Department believes that social service center
  establishments that provide emergency shelter to large transient
  populations should be able to provide bathing facilities that are
  accessible to persons with mobility disabilities who need roll-in
  showers. Because of the transient nature of the population of these
  large shelters, it will not be feasible to modify bathing facilities
  in a timely manner when faced with a need to provide a roll-in
  shower with a seat when requested by an overnight visitor. As a
  result, the Department has added a requirement that social service
  center establishments with sleeping accommodations for more than 50
  individuals must provide at least one roll-in shower with a seat
  that complies with the relevant provisions of section 608 of the
  2010 Standards. Transfer-type showers are not permitted in lieu of a
  roll-in shower with a seat, and the exceptions in sections 608.3 and
  608.4 for residential dwelling units are not permitted. When
  separate shower facilities are provided for men and for women, at
  least one roll-in shower must be provided for each group. This
  supplemental requirement to the residential facilities standards is
  in addition to the supplemental requirement that was proposed in the
  NPRM for clear floor space in sleeping rooms with more than 25 beds.

The Department also notes that while dwelling units at some
  social service center establishments are also subject to FHAct
  design and construction requirements that require certain features
  of adaptable and accessible design, FHAct units do not provide the
  same level of accessibility that is required for residential
  facilities under the 2010 Standards. The FHAct requirements, where
  also applicable, should not be considered a substitute for the 2010
  Standards. Rather, the 2010 Standards must be followed in addition
  to the FHAct requirements.

The Department also notes that while in the NPRM the Department
  used the term &ldquo;social service establishment,&rdquo; the final rule uses
  the term &ldquo;social service center establishment.&rdquo; The Department has
  made this editorial change so that the final rule is consistent with
  the terminology used in the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. 12181(7)(K).

### &sect; 36.406(e) Housing at a Place of Education

The Department of Justice and the Department of Education share
  responsibility for regulation and enforcement of the ADA in
  postsecondary educational settings, including architectural
  features. Housing types in educational settings range from
  traditional residence halls and dormitories to apartment or
  townhouse-style residences. In addition to title III of the ADA, universities and schools that are
  recipients of Federal financial assistance also are subject to
  section 504, which contains its own accessibility requirements
  currently through the application of UFAS. Residential housing,
  including housing in an educational setting, is also covered by the
  FHAct, which requires newly constructed multifamily housing to
  include certain features of accessible and adaptable design. Covered
  entities subject to the ADA must always be aware of, and comply
  with, any other Federal statutes or regulations that govern the
operation of residential properties.

Although the 1991 Standards mention dormitories as a form of
  transient lodging, they do not specifically address how the ADA
  applies to dormitories and other types of residential housing
  provided in an educational setting. The 1991 Standards also do not
  contain any specific provisions for residential facilities, allowing
  covered entities to elect to follow the residential standards
  contained in UFAS. Although the 2004 ADAAG contains provisions for
  both residential facilities and transient lodging, the guidelines do
  not indicate which requirements apply to housing provided in an
  educational setting, leaving it to the adopting agencies to make
  that choice. After evaluating both sets of standards, the Department
  concluded that the benefits of applying the transient lodging
  standards outweighed the benefits of applying the residential
  facilities standards. Consequently, in the NPRM, the Department
  proposed a new Sec.  36.406(e) that provided that residence halls or
  dormitories operated by or on behalf of places of education shall
  comply with the provisions of the proposed standards for transient
  lodging, including, but not limited to, the provisions in sections
  224 and 806 of the 2004 ADAAG.

Private universities and schools covered by title III as public
  accommodations are required to make their programs and activities
  accessible to persons with disabilities. The housing facilities that
  they provide have varied characteristics. College and university
  housing facilities typically provide housing for up to one academic
  year, but may be closed during school vacation periods. In the
  summer, they often are used for short-term stays of one to three
  days, a week, or several months. Graduate and faculty housing often
  is provided year-round in the form of apartments, which may serve
  individuals or families with children. These housing facilities are
  diverse in their layout. Some are double-occupancy rooms with a
  shared toilet and bathing room, which may be inside or outside the
  unit. Others may contain cluster, suite, or group arrangements where
  several rooms are located inside a defined unit with bathing,
  kitchen, and similar common facilities. In some cases, these suites
  are indistinguishable in features from traditional apartments.
  Universities may build their own housing facilities or enter into
  agreements with private developers to build, own, or lease housing
  to the educational institution or to its students. Academic housing
  may be located on the campus of the university or may be located in
  nearby neighborhoods.

Throughout the school year and the summer, academic housing can
  become program areas in which small groups meet, receptions and
  educational sessions are held, and social activities occur. The
  ability to move between rooms--both accessible rooms and standard
  rooms--in order to socialize, to study, and to use all public use
  and common use areas is an essential part of having access to these
  educational programs and activities. Academic housing also is used
  for short-term transient educational programs during the time
  students are not in regular residence and may be rented out to
  transient visitors in a manner similar to a hotel for special
  university functions.

The Department was concerned that applying the new construction
  requirements for residential facilities to educational housing
  facilities could hinder access to educational programs for students
  with disabilities. Elevators generally are not required under the
  2004 ADAAG residential facilities standards unless they are needed
  to provide an accessible route from accessible units to public use
  and common use areas, while under the 2004 ADAAG as it applies to
  other types of facilities, multistory private facilities must have
  elevators unless they meet very specific exceptions. In addition,
  the residential facilities standards do not require accessible roll-
  in showers in bathrooms, while the transient lodging requirements
  require some of the accessible units to be served by bathrooms with
  roll-in showers. The transient lodging standards also require that a
  greater number of units have accessible features for persons with
  communication disabilities. The transient lodging standards provide
  for installation of the required accessible features so that they
  are available immediately, but the residential facilities standards
  allow for certain features of the unit to be adaptable. For example,
  only reinforcements for grab bars need to be provided in residential
  dwellings, but the actual grab bars must be installed under the
  transient lodging standards. By contrast, the residential facilities
  standards do require certain features that provide greater
  accessibility within units, such as usable kitchens and an
  accessible route throughout the dwelling. The residential facilities
  standards also require 5 percent of the units to be accessible to
  persons with mobility disabilities, which is a continuation of the
  same scoping that is currently required under UFAS and is therefore
  applicable to any educational institution that is covered by section 504. The transient lodging standards require a lower percentage of
  accessible sleeping rooms for facilities with large numbers of rooms
  than is required by UFAS. For example, if a dormitory has 150 rooms,
  the transient lodging standards would require 7 accessible rooms,
  while the residential standards would require 8. In a large
  dormitory with 500 rooms, the transient lodging standards would
  require 13 accessible rooms, and the residential facilities
  standards would require 25. There are other differences between the
  two sets of standards, including requirements for accessible
  windows, alterations, kitchens, an accessible route throughout a
  unit, and clear floor space in bathrooms allowing for a side
  transfer.

In the NPRM, the Department requested public comment on how to
  scope educational housing facilities, and it asked whether the
  residential facilities requirements or the transient lodging
  requirements in the 2004 ADAAG would be more appropriate for housing
  at places of education and asked how the different requirements
  would affect the cost of building new dormitories and other student
  housing. See 73 FR 34508, 34545 (June 17, 2008).

The Department received several comments on this issue under
  title III. One commenter stated that the Department should adopt the
  residential facilities standards for housing at a place of
  education. In the commenter's view, the residential facilities
  standards are congruent with overlapping requirements imposed by
  HUD, and the residential facilities requirements would ensure
  dispersion of accessible features more effectively. This commenter
  also argued that while the increased number of required accessible
  units for residential facilities as compared to transient lodging
  may increase the cost of construction or alteration, this cost would
  be offset by a reduced need later to adapt rooms if the demand for
  accessible rooms exceeds the supply. The commenter also encouraged
  the Department to impose a visitability (accessible doorways and
  necessary clear floor space for turning radius) requirement for both
  the residential facilities and transient lodging requirements to
  allow students with mobility impairments to interact and socialize
  in a fully integrated fashion. Another commenter stated that while
  dormitories should be treated like residences as opposed to
  transient lodging, the Department should ensure that &ldquo;all floors
  are accessible,&rdquo; thus ensuring community integration and
  visitability. Another commenter argued that housing at a place of
  education is comparable to residential housing, and that most of the
  housing types used by schools do not have the same amenities and
  services or function like transient lodging and should not be
  treated as such.

Several commenters focused on the length of stay at this type of
  housing and suggested that if the facilities are subject to
  occupancy for greater than 30 days, the residential standards should
  apply. Another commenter supported the Department's adoption of the
  transient lodging standards, arguing this will provide greater
  accessibility and therefore increase opportunities for students with
  disabilities to participate. One commenter, while supporting the use
  of transient lodging standards in this area, argued that the
  Department also should develop regulations relating to the usability
  of equipment in housing facilities by persons who are blind or
  visually impaired. Another commenter argued that the Department
  should not impose the transient lodging requirements on K-12 schools
  because the cost of adding elevators can be prohibitive, and because
  there are safety concerns related to evacuating students in
  wheelchairs living on floors above the ground floor in emergencies
  causing elevator failures.

The Department has considered the comments recommending the use
  of the residential facilities standards and acknowledges that they require
  certain features that are not included in the transient lodging
  standards and that should be required for housing provided at a
  place of education. In addition, the Department notes that since
  educational institutions often use their academic housing facilities
  as short-term transient lodging in the summers, it is important that
  accessible features be installed at the outset. It is not realistic
  to expect that the educational institution will be able to adapt a
  unit in a timely manner in order to provide accessible
  accommodations to someone attending a one-week program during the
summer.

The Department has determined that the best approach to this
  type of housing is to continue to require the application of
  transient lodging standards but, at the same time, to add several
  requirements drawn from the residential facilities standards related
  to accessible turning spaces and work surfaces in kitchens, and the
  accessible route throughout the unit. This will ensure the
  maintenance of the transient lodging standard requirements related
  to access to all floors of the facility, roll-in showers in
  facilities with more than 50 sleeping rooms, and other important
  accessibility features not found in the residential facilities
  standards, but also will ensure usable kitchens and access to all
  the rooms in a suite or apartment.

The Department has added a new definition to Sec.  36.104,
  &ldquo;Housing at a Place of Education,&rdquo; and has revised Sec.  36.406(e)
  to reflect the accessible features that now will be required in
  addition to the requirements set forth under the transient lodging
  standards. The Department also recognizes that some educational
  institutions provide some residential housing on a year-round basis
  to graduate students and staff that is comparable to private rental
  housing but contains no facilities for educational programming.
  Section 36.406(e)(3) exempts from the transient lodging standards
  apartments or townhouse facilities that are provided with a lease on
  a year-round basis exclusively to graduate students or faculty and
  that do not contain any public use or common use areas available for
  educational programming; instead, such housing must comply with the
  requirements for residential facilities in sections 233 and 809 of
  the 2010 Standards.

The regulatory text uses the term &ldquo;sleeping room&rdquo; in lieu of
  the term &ldquo;guest room,&rdquo; which is the term used in the transient
  lodging standards. The Department is using this term because it
  believes that for the most part, it provides a better description of
  the sleeping facilities used in a place of education than &ldquo;guest
  room.&rdquo; The final rule states in Sec.  36.406(e) that the Department
  intends the terms to be used interchangeably in the application of
  the transient lodging standards to housing at a place of education.

### &sect; 36.406(f) Assembly Areas

In the NPRM, the Department proposed Sec.  36.406(f) to
  supplement the assembly area requirements of the 2004 ADAAG, which
  the Department is adopting as part of the 2010 Standards. The NPRM
  proposed at Sec.  36.406(f)(1) to require wheelchair spaces and
  companion seating locations to be dispersed to all levels of the
  facility that are served by an accessible route. The Department
  received no significant comments on this paragraph and has decided
  to adopt the proposed language with minor modifications.

Section 36.406(f)(1) ensures that there is greater dispersion of
  wheelchair spaces and companion seats throughout stadiums, arenas,
  and grandstands than would otherwise be required by sections 221 and
  802 of the 2004 ADAAG. In some cases, the accessible route may not
  be the same route that other individuals use to reach their seats. For example, if other patrons reach their seats on the field by an
  inaccessible route (e.g., by stairs), but there is an accessible
  route that complies with section 206.3 of the 2004 ADAAG that could
  be connected to seats on the field, wheelchair spaces and companion
  seats must be placed on the field even if that route is not
  generally available to the public.

Regulatory language that was included in the 2004 ADAAG
  advisory, but that did not appear in the NPRM, has been added by the
  Department in Sec.  36.406(f)(2). Section 36.406(f)(2) now requires
  an assembly area that has seating encircling, in whole or in part, a
  field of play or performance area, such as an arena or stadium, to
  place wheelchair spaces and companion seats around the entire
  facility. This rule, which is designed to prevent a public
  accommodation from placing wheelchair spaces and companion seats on
  one side of the facility only, is consistent with the Department's
  enforcement practices and reflects its interpretation of section
  4.33.3 of the 1991 Standards.

In the NPRM, the Department proposed Sec. 36.406(f)(2), which
  prohibits wheelchair spaces and companion seating locations from
  being &ldquo;located on (or obstructed by) temporary platforms.&rdquo;
  73 FR 34508, 34557 (June 17, 2008). Through its enforcement actions,
  the Department discovered that some venues place wheelchair spaces
  and companion seats on temporary platforms that, when removed,
  reveal conventional seating underneath, or cover the wheelchair
  spaces and companion seats with temporary platforms on top of which
  they place risers of conventional seating. These platforms cover
  groups of conventional seats and are used to provide groups of
  wheelchair seats and companion seats.

Several commenters requested an exception to the prohibition of
  the use of temporary platforms for public accommodations that sell
  most of their tickets on a season-ticket or other multi-event basis.
  Such commenters argued that they should be able to use temporary
  platforms because they know, in advance, that the patrons sitting in
  certain areas for the whole season do not need wheelchair spaces and
  companion seats. The Department declines to adopt such an exception.
  As it explained in detail in the NPRM, the Department believes that
  permitting the use of movable platforms that seat four or more
  wheelchair users and their companions have the potential to reduce
  the number of available wheelchair seating spaces below the level
  required, thus reducing the opportunities for persons who need
  accessible seating to have the same choice of ticket prices and
  amenities that are available to other patrons in the facility. In
  addition, use of removable platforms may result in instances where
  last minute requests for wheelchair and companion seating cannot be
  met because entire sections of accessible seating will be lost when
  a platform is removed. See 73 FR 34508, 34546 (June 17, 2008). Further, use of temporary platforms allows facilities to limit
  persons who need accessible seating to certain seating areas, and to
  relegate accessible seating to less desirable locations. The use of
  temporary platforms has the effect of neutralizing dispersion and
  other seating requirements (e.g., line of sight) for wheelchair
  spaces and companion seats. Cf. Independent Living Resources v.
  Oregon Arena Corp., 1 F. Supp. 2d 1159, 1171 (D. Or. 1998) (holding
  that while a public accommodation may &ldquo;infill&rdquo; wheelchair spaces
  with removable seats when the wheelchair spaces are not needed to
  accommodate individuals with disabilities, under certain
  circumstances &ldquo;[s]uch a practice might well violate the rule that
  wheelchair spaces must be dispersed throughout the arena in a manner
  that is roughly proportionate to the overall distribution of
  seating&rdquo;). In addition, using temporary platforms to convert unsold
  wheelchair spaces to conventional seating undermines the flexibility
  facilities need to accommodate secondary ticket market exchanges as
  required by Sec.  36.302(f)(7) of the final rule.

As the Department explained in the NPRM, however, this provision
  was not designed to prohibit temporary seating that increases
  seating for events (e.g., placing temporary seating on the floor of
  a basketball court for a concert). Consequently, the final rule, at
  Sec.  36.406(f)(3), has been amended to clarify that if an entire
  seating section is on a temporary platform for a particular event,
  then wheelchair spaces and companion seats may also be in that
  seating section. However, adding a temporary platform to create
  wheelchair spaces and companion seats that are otherwise dissimilar
  from nearby fixed seating and then simply adding a small number of
  additional seats to the platform would not qualify as an &ldquo;entire
  seating section&rdquo; on the platform. In addition, Sec.  36.406(f)(3)
  clarifies that facilities may fill in wheelchair spaces with
  removable seats when the wheelchair spaces are not needed by persons
  who use wheelchairs.

The Department has been responsive to assembly areas' concerns
  about reduced revenues due to unused accessible seating.
  Accordingly, the Department has reduced scoping requirements
  significantly--by almost half in large assembly areas--and
  determined that allowing assembly areas to in-fill unsold wheelchair
  spaces with readily removable temporary individual seats
  appropriately balances their economic concerns with the rights of
  individuals with disabilities. See section 221.1 of the 2010
  Standards.

For stadium-style movie theaters, in Sec.  36.406(f)(4) of the
  NPRM the Department proposed requiring placement of wheelchair seating spaces and
  companion seats on a riser or cross-aisle in the stadium section of
  the theater that satisfies at least one of the following criteria:
  (1) It is located within the rear 60 percent of the seats provided
  in the auditorium; or (2) It is located within the area of the
  auditorium where the vertical viewing angles are between the 40th
  and 100th percentile of vertical viewing angles for all seats in
  that theater as ranked from the first row (1st percentile) to the
  back row (100th percentile). The vertical viewing angle is the angle
  between a horizontal line perpendicular to the seated viewer's eye
  to the screen and a line from the seated viewer's eye to the top of
the screen.

The Department proposed this bright-line rule for two reasons:
  (1) the movie theater industry petitioned for such a rule; and (2)
  the Department has acquired expertise in the design of stadium-style
  theaters during its litigation with several major movie theater
  chains. See United States. v. AMC Entertainment, Inc., 232 F.
  Supp.2d 1092 (C.D. Cal. 2002), rev'd in part, 549 F.3d 760 (9th Cir.
  2008); United States v. Cinemark USA, Inc., 348 F.3d 569 (6th Cir.
  2003). Two industry commenters--at least one of whom otherwise
  supported this rule--requested that the Department explicitly state
  that this rule does not apply retroactively to existing theaters. Although this provision on its face applies to new construction and
  alterations, these commenters were concerned that the rule could be
  interpreted to apply retroactively because of the Department's
  statements in the NPRM and ANPRM that this bright line rule,
  although newly articulated, is not a new standard but &ldquo;merely
  codifi[es] longstanding Department requirement[s],&rdquo; 73 FR 34508,
  34534 (June 17, 2008), and does not represent a &ldquo;substantive change
  from the existing line-of-sight requirements&rdquo; of section 4.33.3 of
  the 1991 Standards, 69 FR 58768, 58776 (Sept. 30, 2004).
  Although the Department intends for Sec.  36.406(f)(4) of this
  rule to apply prospectively to new construction and alterations,
  this rule is not a departure from, and is consistent with, the line-
  of-sight requirements in the 1991 Standards. The Department has
  always interpreted the line-of-sight requirements in the 1991
  Standards to require viewing angles provided to patrons who use
  wheelchairs to be comparable to those afforded to other spectators.
  Section 36.406(f)(4) merely represents the application of these
  requirements to stadium-style movie theaters.

One commenter from a trade association sought clarification
  whether Sec.  36.406(f)(4) applies to stadium-style theaters with
  more than 300 seats, and argued that it should not since dispersion
  requirements apply in those theaters. The Department declines to
  limit this rule to stadium-style theaters with 300 or fewer seats;
  stadium-style theaters of all sizes must comply with this rule. So,
  for example, stadium-style theaters that must vertically disperse
  wheelchair spaces and companion seats must do so within the
  parameters of this rule.

The NPRM included a provision that required assembly areas with
  more than 5,000 seats to provide at least five wheelchair spaces
  with at least three companion seats for each of those five
  wheelchair spaces. The Department agrees with commenters who
  asserted that group seating is better addressed through ticketing
  policies rather than design and has deleted that provision from this
  section of the final rule.

### &sect; 36.406(g) Medical Care Facilities

In the 1991 title III regulation, there was no provision
  addressing the dispersion of accessible sleeping rooms in medical
  care facilities. The Department is aware, however, of problems that
  individuals with disabilities face in receiving full and equal
  medical care when accessible sleeping rooms are not adequately
  dispersed. When accessible rooms are not fully dispersed, a person
  with a disability is often placed in an accessible room in an area
  that is not medically appropriate for his or her condition, and is
  thus denied quick access to staff with expertise in that medical
  specialty and specialized equipment. While the Access Board did not
  establish specific design requirements for dispersion in the 2004
  ADAAG, in response to extensive comments in support of dispersion it
  added an advisory note, Advisory 223.1 General, encouraging
  dispersion of accessible rooms within the facility so that
  accessible rooms are more likely to be proximate to appropriate
  qualified staff and resources.

In the NPRM, the Department sought additional comment on the
  issue, asking whether it should require medical care facilities,
  such as hospitals, to disperse their accessible sleeping rooms, and
  if so, by what method (by specialty area, floor, or other criteria).
  All of the comments the Department received on this issue supported
  dispersing accessible sleeping rooms proportionally by specialty
  area. These comments from individuals, organizations, and a building
  code association, argued that it would not be difficult for
  hospitals to disperse rooms by specialty area, given the high level
  of regulation to which hospitals are subject and the planning that
  hospitals do based on utilization trends. Further, comments suggest
  that without a requirement, it is unlikely that hospitals would
  disperse the rooms. In addition, concentrating accessible rooms in
  one area perpetuates segregation of individuals with disabilities,
  which is counter to the purpose of the ADA.

The Department has decided to require medical care facilities to
  disperse their accessible sleeping rooms in a manner that is
  proportionate by type of medical specialty. This does not require
  exact mathematical proportionality, which at times would be
  impossible. However, it does require that medical care facilities
  disperse their accessible rooms by medical specialty so that persons
  with disabilities can, to the extent practical, stay in an
  accessible room within the wing or ward that is appropriate for
  their medical needs. The language used in this rule (&ldquo;in a manner
  that is proportionate by type of medical specialty&rdquo;) is more
  specific than that used in the NPRM (&ldquo;in a manner that enables
  patients with disabilities to have access to appropriate specialty
  services&rdquo;) and adopts the concept of proportionality proposed by
  the commenters. Accessible rooms should be dispersed throughout all
  medical specialties, such as obstetrics, orthopedics, pediatrics,
  and cardiac care.

## Analysis and Commentary on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design

### <a id="appb"></a>Appendix B to part 36:  Analysis and Commentary on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design

The following is a
  discussion of substantive changes in the scoping and technical requirements for
  new construction and alterations resulting from the adoption of new ADA
  Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards) in the final rules for title
  II (28 CFR part 35) and title III (28 CFR part 36) of the Americans with
  Disabilities Act (ADA). The full text of the 2010 Standards is available for
  review at <b><u style='text-underline:thick'>www.ada.gov</u></b>.

In the Department&acute;s
  revised ADA title II regulation, 28 CFR 35.104 Definitions, the Department
  defines the term &quot;2010 Standards&quot; to mean the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible
  Design. The 2010 Standards consist of the 2004 ADA Accessibility Guidelines
  (ADAAG) and the requirements contained in 28 CFR 35.151.

In the Department&acute;s
  revised ADA title III regulation, 28 CFR 36.104 Definitions, the Department
  defines the term &quot;2010 Standards&quot; to mean the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible
  Design. The 2010 Standards consist of the 2004 ADA Accessibility Guidelines
  (ADAAG) and the requirements contained in 28 CFR part 36 subpart D.

This summary addresses selected
  substantive changes between the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (1991
  Standards) codified at 28 CFR part 36, app. A (2009) and the 2010 Standards. Editorial changes are not
  discussed. Scoping and technical requirements are discussed together, where
  appropriate, for ease of understanding the requirements. In addition, this
  document addresses selected public comments received by the Department in
  response to its September 2004 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM)
  and its June 2008 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).

The ANPRM and NPRM issued
  by the Department concerning the proposed 2010 Standards stated that comments
  received by the Access Board in response to its development of the ADAAG upon
  which the 2010 Standards are based would be considered in the development of
  the final Standards. Therefore, the Department will not restate here all of the
  comments and responses to them issued by the Access Board. The Department is
  supplementing the Access Board&acute;s comments and responses with substantive
  comments and responses here. Comments and responses addressed by the Access
  Board that also were separately submitted to the Department will not be
  restated in their entirety here.

## Section-by-Section Analysis with Public Comments

### Application and Administration

#### 102 Dimensions for Adults and Children

Section 2.1 of the 1991
  Standards stated that the specifications were based upon adult dimensions and
  anthropometrics. The 1991 Standards did not provide specific requirements for
  children&acute;s elements or facilities.

Section 102 of the 2010
  Standards states that the technical requirements are based on adult dimensions
  and anthropometrics. In addition, technical requirements are also provided
  based on children&acute;s dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains,
  water closets and other elements located in toilet compartments, lavatories and
  sinks, dining surfaces, and work surfaces.

#### 103 Equivalent Facilitation

This section acknowledges
  that nothing in these requirements prevents the use of designs, products, or
  technologies as alternatives to those prescribed, provided that the
  alternatives result in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and
  usability.

A commenter encouraged
  the Department to include a procedure for determining equivalent facilitation.
  The Department believes that the responsibility for determining and demonstrating
  equivalent facilitation properly rests with the covered entity. The purpose of
  allowing for equivalent facilitation is to encourage flexibility and innovation
  while still ensuring access. The Department believes that establishing
  potentially cumbersome bureaucratic provisions for reviewing requests for
  equivalent facilitation is inappropriate.

#### 104 Conventions

**Dimensions.** Section 104.1
  of the 2010 Standards notes that dimensions not stated as a &quot;maximum&quot; or
  &quot;minimum&quot; are absolute. Section 104.1.1 of the 2010 Standards provides that all
  dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the
  requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end
  points. A commenter stated that
  the 2010 Standards restrict the application of construction tolerances only to
  those few requirements that are expressed as an absolute dimension.

This is an incorrect
  interpretation of sections 104.1 and 104.1.1 of the 2010 Standards.
  Construction and manufacturing tolerances apply to absolute dimensions as well
  as to dimensions expressed as a maximum or minimum. When the requirement states
  a specified range, such as in section 609.4 where grab bars must be installed
  between 33 inches and 36 inches above the finished floor, that range provides
  an adequate tolerance. Advisory 104.1.1 gives further guidance about
  tolerances.

Section 104.2 of the 2010
  Standards provides that where the required number of elements or facilities to
  be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and
  remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such elements
  or facilities shall be provided. Where the determination of the required size
  or dimension of an element or facility involves ratios or percentages, rounding
  down for values less than one-half is permissible.

A commenter stated that
  it is customary in the building code industry to round up rather than down for
  values less than one-half. As noted here, where the 2010 Standards provide for
  scoping, any resulting fractional calculations will be rounded to the next
  whole number. The Department is retaining the portion of section 104.2 that
  permits rounding down for values less than one-half where the determination of
  the required size or dimension of an element or facility involves ratios or
  percentages. Such practice is standard with the industry, and is in keeping
  with model building codes.

#### 105 Referenced Standards

Section 105 lists the
  industry requirements that are referenced in the 2010 Standards. This section
  also clarifies that where there is a difference between a provision of the 2010
  Standards and the referenced requirements, the provision of the 2010 Standards
  applies.

#### 106 Definitions

Various definitions have
  been added to the 2010 Standards and some definitions have been deleted.

One commenter asked that
  the term public right-of-way be defined; others asked that various terms and
  words defined by the 1991 Standards, but which were eliminated from the 2010
  Standards, plus other words and terms used in the 2010 Standards, be defined.

The Department believes
  that it is not necessary to add definitions to this text because section 106.3
  of the 2010 Standards provides that the meanings of terms not specifically
  defined in the 2010 Standards, in the Department&acute;s ADA regulations, or in
  referenced standards are to be defined by collegiate dictionaries in the sense
  that the context implies. The Department believes that this provision
  adequately addresses these commenters&acute; concerns.

### Scoping and Technical Requirements

#### 202 Existing Buildings and Facilities

**Alterations.** Under section
  4.1.6(1)(c) of the 1991 Standards if alterations to single elements, when
  considered together, amount to an alteration of a room or space in a building
  or facility, the entire room or space would have to be made accessible. This
  requirement was interpreted to mean that if a covered entity chose to alter
  several elements in a room there would come a point when so much work had been
  done that it would be considered that the entire room or space would have to be
  made accessible. Under section 202.3 of the 2010 Standards entities can alter
  as many elements within a room or space as they like without triggering a
  requirement to make the entire room or space accessible based on the alteration
  of individual elements. This does not, however, change the requirement that if
  the intent was to alter the entire room or space, the entire room or space must
  be made accessible and comply with the applicable requirements of Chapter 2 of
  the 2010 Standards.

**Alterations to Primary Function Areas.** Section 202.4 restates a current requirement under title
  III, and therefore represents no change for title III facilities or for those
  title II facilities that have elected to comply with the 1991 Standards. However,
  under the revised title II regulation, state and local government facilities
  that have previously elected to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility
  Standards (UFAS) instead of the 1991 Standards will no longer have that option,
  and thus will now be subject to the path of travel requirement. The path of
  travel requirement provides that when a primary function area of an existing
  facility is altered, the path of travel to that area (including restrooms,
  telephones, and drinking fountains serving the area) must also be made
  accessible, but only to the extent that the cost of doing so does not exceed
  twenty percent (20%) of the cost of the alterations to the primary function
  area. The UFAS requirements for a substantial alteration, though different, may
  have covered some of the items that will now be covered by the path of travel
  requirement.

**Visible Alarms in Alterations to Existing Facilities.** The 1991 Standards, at sections
  4.1.3(14) and 4.1.6(1)(b), and sections 202.3 and 215.1 of the 2010 Standards
  require that when existing elements and spaces of a facility are altered, the
  alterations must comply with new construction requirements. Section 215.1 of
  the 2010 Standards adds a new exception to the scoping requirement for visible
  alarms in existing facilities so that visible alarms must be installed only
  when an existing fire alarm system is upgraded or replaced, or a new fire alarm
  system is installed.

Some commenters urged the
  Department not to include the exception and to make visible alarms a mandatory
  requirement for all spaces, both existing and new. Other commenters said that
  the exception will make the safety of individuals with disabilities dependent
  upon the varying age of existing fire alarm systems. Other commenters suggested
  that including this requirement, even with the exception, will result in
  significant cost to building owners and operators.

The Department believes
  that the language of the exception to section 215.1 of the 2010 Standards
  strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of individuals with
  disabilities and those of the business community. If undertaken at the time a
  system is installed, whether in a new facility or in a planned system upgrade,
  the cost of adding visible alarms is reasonable. Over time, existing facilities
  will become fully accessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing,
  and will add minimal costs to owners and operators.

#### 203 General Exceptions

**Limited Access Spaces and Machinery Spaces.** The 1991 Standards, at section 4.1.1, contain an exception
  that exempts &quot;non-occupiable&quot; spaces that have limited means of access, such as
  ladders or very narrow passageways, and that are visited only by service
  personnel for maintenance, repair, or occasional monitoring of equipment, from
  all accessibility requirements. Sections 203.4 and 203.5 of the 2010 Standards
  expand this exception by removing the condition that the exempt spaces be
  &quot;non-occupiable,&quot; and by separating the other conditions into two independent
  exceptions: one for spaces with limited means of access, and the other for
  machinery spaces. More spaces are exempted by the exception in the 2010
  Standards.

#### 203, 206 and 215 Employee Work Areas

**Common Use Circulation Paths in Employee Work Areas.** The 1991 Standards at section
  4.1.1(3), and the 2010 Standards at section 203.9, require employee work areas
  in new construction and alterations *only* to
  be designed and constructed so that individuals with disabilities can approach,
  enter, and exit the areas. Section 206.2.8 of the 2010 Standards requires
  accessible common use circulation paths within employee work areas unless they
  are subject to exceptions in sections 206.2.8, 403.5, 405.5, and 405.8. The
  ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12112 (b)(5)(A) and (B), requires employers to make reasonable
  accommodations in the workplace for individuals with disabilities, which may
  include modifications to work areas when needed. Providing increased access in
  the facility at the time of construction or alteration will simplify the
  process of providing reasonable accommodations when they are needed.

The requirement for
  accessible common use circulation paths will not apply to existing facilities
  pursuant to the readily achievable barrier removal requirement. The Department
  has consistently taken the position that barrier removal requirements do not
  apply to areas used exclusively by employees because the purpose of title III
  is to ensure that access is provided to clients and customers. See
  Appendix B to the 1991 regulation implementing title III, 28 CFR part 36.

Several exceptions to
  section 206.2.8 of the 2010 Standards exempt common use circulation paths in
  employee work areas from the requirements of section 402 where it may be
  difficult to comply with the technical requirements for accessible routes due
  to the size or function of the area:

- Employee work areas, or portions of
employee work areas, that are less than 300 square feet and are elevated 7
inches or more above the ground or finish floor, where elevation is essential
to the function of the space, are exempt.
- Common use circulation paths within
employee work areas that are less than 1,000 square feet and are defined by
permanently installed partitions, counters, casework, or furnishings are
exempt. Kitchens in quick service restaurants, cocktail bars, and the employee
side of service counters are frequently covered by this exception.
- Common use circulation paths within
employee work areas that are an integral component of equipment are exempt.
Common use circulation paths within large pieces of equipment in factories,
electric power plants, and amusement rides are covered by this exception.
- Common use circulation paths within
exterior employee work areas that are fully exposed to the weather are exempt.
Farms, ranches, and outdoor maintenance facilities are covered by this
exception.

The 2010 Standards in
  sections 403.5 and 405.8 also contain exceptions to the technical requirements
  for accessible routes for circulation paths in employee work areas:

- Machinery and equipment are permitted to
reduce the clear width of common use circulation paths where the reduction is
essential to the function of the work performed. Machinery and equipment that
must be placed a certain way to work properly, or for ergonomics or to prevent
workplace injuries are covered by this exception.
- Handrails are not required on ramps,
provided that they can be added in the future.

Commenters stated that
  the requirements set out in the 2010 Standards for accessible common use
  circulation paths in employee work areas are inappropriate, particularly in
  commercial kitchens, storerooms, and behind cocktail bars where wheelchairs
  would not be easily accommodated. These commenters further urged the Department
  not to adopt a requirement that circulation paths in employee work areas be at least
  36 inches wide, including those at emergency exits.

These commenters
  misunderstand the scope of the provision. Nothing in the 2010 Standards
  requires all circulation paths in non-exempt areas to be accessible. The
  Department recognizes that building codes and fire and life safety codes, which
  are adopted by all of the states, require *primary* circulation paths in facilities, including employee work areas, to be at least
  36 inches wide for purposes of emergency egress. Accessible routes also are at
  least 36 inches wide. Therefore, the Department anticipates that covered
  entities will be able to satisfy the requirement to provide accessible
  circulation paths by ensuring that their required *primary* circulation paths are accessible.

Individual employee work
  stations, such as a grocery checkout counter or an automobile service bay
  designed for use by one person, do not contain common use circulation paths and
  are not required to comply. Other work areas, such as stockrooms that typically
  have narrow pathways between shelves, would be required to design only one
  accessible circulation path into the stockroom. It would not be necessary to
  make each circulation path in the room accessible. In alterations it may be
  technically infeasible to provide accessible common use circulation paths in
  some employee work areas. For example, in a stock room of a department store
  significant existing physical constraints, such as having to move walls to
  avoid the loss of space to store inventory, may mean that it is technically
  infeasible (*see* section 106.5 &quot;Defined Terms&quot; of the 2010
  Standards) to make even the primary common use circulation path in that stock
  room wide enough to be accessible. In addition, the 2010 Standards include
  exceptions for common use circulation paths in employee work areas where it may
  be difficult to comply with the technical requirements for accessible routes
  due to the size or function of the areas. The Department believes that these
  exceptions will provide the flexibility necessary to ensure that this
  requirement does not interfere with legitimate business operations.

**Visible Alarms.** Section 215.3
  of the 2010 Standards provides that where employee work areas in newly
  constructed facilities have audible alarm coverage they are required to have
  wiring systems that are capable of supporting visible alarms that comply with
  section 702 of the 2010 Standards. The 1991 Standards, at section 4.1.1(3),
  require visible alarms to be provided where audible fire alarm systems are
  provided, but do not require areas used only by employees as work areas to be
  equipped with accessibility features. As applied to office buildings, the 1991
  Standards require visible alarms to be provided in public and common use areas
  such as hallways, conference rooms, break rooms, and restrooms, where audible
  fire alarm systems are provided.

Commenters asserted that
  the requirements of section 215.3 of the 2010 Standards would be burdensome to
  meet. These commenters also raised concerns that all employee work areas within
  existing buildings and facilities must be equipped with accessibility features.

The commenters&acute; concerns
  about section 215.3 of the 2010 Standards represent a misunderstanding of the
  requirements applicable to employee work areas.

Newly constructed
  buildings and facilities merely are required to provide wiring so that visible
  alarm systems can be added as needed to accommodate employees who are deaf or
  hard of hearing. This is a minimal requirement without significant impact.

The other issue in the
  comments represents a misunderstanding of the Department&acute;s existing regulatory
  requirements. Employee common use areas in covered facilities (*e.g.*,
  locker rooms, break rooms, cafeterias, toilet rooms, corridors to exits, and
  other common use spaces) were required to be accessible under the 1991
  Standards; areas in which employees actually perform their jobs are required to
  enable a person using a wheelchair or mobility device to approach, enter, and
  exit the area. The 2010 Standards require increased access through the
  accessible *common use* circulation
  path requirement, but neither the 1991 Standards nor the 2010 Standards require
  employee work stations to be accessible.  Access to specific employee *work stations* is governed by title I of the ADA.

#### 205 and 309 Operable Parts

Section 4.1.3, and more specifically sections 4.1.3(13), 4.27.3, and 4.27.4 of the 1991 Standards,
  require operable parts on accessible elements, along accessible routes, and in
  accessible rooms and spaces to comply with the technical requirements for
  operable parts, including height and operation. The 1991 Standards, at section
  4.27.3, contain an exception, &quot;where the use of special equipment
  dictates otherwise or where electrical and communications systems receptacles
  are not normally intended for use by building occupants,&quot; from the technical
  requirement for the height of operable parts. Section 205.1 of the 2010
  Standards divides this exception into three exceptions covering operable parts
  intended only for use by service or maintenance personnel, electrical or
  communication receptacles serving a dedicated use, and floor electrical
  receptacles. Operable parts covered by these new exceptions are exempt from all
  of the technical requirements for operable parts in section 309. The 2010 Standards
  also add exceptions that exempt certain outlets at kitchen counters; heating,
  ventilating and air conditioning diffusers; redundant controls provided for a
  single element, other than light switches; and exercise machines and equipment
  from all of the technical requirements for operable parts. Exception 7, in
  section 205.1 of the 2010 Standards, exempts cleats and other boat securement
  devices from the accessible height requirement. Similarly, section 309.4 of the 2010 Standards exempts gas
  pump nozzles, but only from the technical requirement for activating force.

**Reach Ranges.** The 1991
  Standards set the maximum height for side reach at 54 inches above the floor.
  The 2010 Standards, at section 308.3, lower that maximum height to 48 inches
  above the finish floor or ground. The 2010 Standards also add exceptions, as
  discussed above, to the scoping requirement for operable parts for certain
  elements that, among other things, will exempt them from the reach range
  requirements in section 308.

The 1991 Standards, at
  sections 4.1.3, 4.27.3, and 4.2.6, and the 2010 Standards, at sections 205.1,
  228.1, 228.2, 308.3, and 309.3, require operable parts of accessible elements,
  along accessible routes, and in accessible rooms and spaces to be placed within
  the forward or side-reach ranges specified in section 308. The 2010 Standards
  also require at least five percent (5%) of mailboxes provided in an interior
  location and at least one of each type of depository, vending machine, change
  machine, and gas pump to meet the technical requirements for a forward or a
  side reach.

Section 4.2.6 of the 1991
  Standards specifies a maximum 54-inch high side reach and a minimum 9-inch low
  side reach for an unobstructed reach depth of 10 inches maximum. Section
  308.3.1 of the 2010 Standards specifies a maximum 48-inch high side reach and a
  minimum 15-inch low side reach where the element being reached for is
  unobstructed. Section 308.3.1, Exception 1, permits an obstruction that is no
  deeper than 10 inches between the edge of the clear floor or ground space and
  the element that the individual with a disability is trying to reach. Changes
  in the side-reach range for new construction and alterations in the 2010
  Standards will affect a variety of building elements such as light switches,
  electrical outlets, thermostats, fire alarm pull stations, card readers, and
  keypads.

Commenters were divided
  in their views about the changes to the unobstructed side-reach range.
  Disability advocacy groups and others, including individuals of short stature,
  supported the modifications to the proposed reach range requirements. Other
  commenters stated that the new reach range requirements will be burdensome for
  small businesses to comply with. These comments argued that the new reach range
  requirements restrict design options, especially in residential housing.

The Department continues
  to believe that data submitted by advocacy groups and others provides
  compelling evidence that lowered reach range requirements will better serve
  significantly greater numbers of individuals with disabilities, including
  individuals of short stature, persons with limited upper body strength, and
  others with limited use of their arms and fingers. The change to the side-reach
  range was developed by the Access Board over a prolonged period in which there
  was extensive public participation. This process did not produce any
  significant data to indicate that applying the new unobstructed side-reach
  range requirement in new construction or during alterations would impose a
  significant burden.

#### 206 and Chapter 4 Accessible Routes

**Slope.** The 2010 Standards provide, at
  section 403.3, that the cross slope of walking surfaces not be steeper than
  1:48. The 1991 Standards&acute; cross slope requirement was that it not exceed 1:50.
  A commenter recommended increasing the cross slope requirement to allow a
  maximum of 1/2 inch per foot (1:24) to prevent imperfections in concrete
  surfaces from ponding water. The Department continues to believe that the
  requirement that a cross slope not be steeper than 1:48 adequately provides for
  water drainage in most situations. The suggested changes would double the
  allowable cross slope and create a significant impediment for many wheelchair
  users and others with a mobility disability.

**Accessible Routes from Site Arrival Points and Within Sites.** The 1991 Standards, at sections
  4.1.2(1) and (2), and the 2010 Standards, at sections 206.2.1 and 206.2.2,
  require that at least one accessible route be provided within the site from
  site arrival points to an accessible building entrance and that at least one
  accessible route connect accessible facilities on the same site. The 2010
  Standards also add two exceptions that exempt site arrival points and
  accessible facilities within a site from the accessible route requirements
  where the only means of access between them is a vehicular way that does not
  provide pedestrian access.

Commenters urged the
  Department to eliminate the exception that exempts site arrival points and
  accessible facilities from the accessible route requirements where the only
  means of access between them is a vehicular way not providing pedestrian
  access. The Department declines to accept this recommendation because the
  Department believes that its use will be limited. If it can be reasonably
  anticipated that the route between the site arrival point and the accessible
  facilities will be used by pedestrians, regardless of whether a pedestrian
  route is provided, then this exception will not apply. It will apply only in
  the relatively rare situations where the route between the site arrival point
  and the accessible facility dictates vehicular access &#8211; for example, an
  office complex on an isolated site that has a private access road, or a
  self-service storage facility where all users are expected to drive to their
  storage units.

Another commenter
  suggested that the language of section 406.1 of the 2010 Standards is confusing
  because it states that curb ramps on accessible routes shall comply with 406,
  405.2 through 405.5, and 405.10. The 1991 Standards require that curb ramps be
  provided wherever an accessible route crosses a curb.

The Department declines
  to change this language because the change is purely editorial, resulting from
  the overall changes in the format of the 2010 Standards. It does not change the
  substantive requirement. In the 2010 Standards all elements on a required
  accessible route must be accessible; therefore, if the accessible route crosses
  a curb, a curb ramp must be provided.

**Areas of Sport Activity.** Section 206.2.2 of the 2010 Standards requires at least one accessible route to connect
  accessible buildings, facilities, elements, and spaces on the same site.
  Advisory section 206.2.2 adds the explanation that an accessible route must
  connect the boundary of each area of sport activity (e.g., courts and playing
  fields, whether indoor or outdoor). Section 206.2.12 of the 2010 Standards
  further requires that in court sports the accessible route must directly
  connect both sides of the court.

**Limited-Use/Limited-Application Elevators, Destination-Oriented Elevators and Private Residence Elevators.** The
  1991 Standards, at section 4.1.3(5), and the 2010 Standards, at sections 206.2
  and 206.6, include exceptions to the scoping requirement for accessible routes
  that exempt certain facilities from connecting each story with an elevator. If
  a facility is exempt from the scoping requirement, but nonetheless installs an
  elevator, the 1991 Standards require the elevator to comply with the technical
  requirements for elevators. The 2010 Standards add a new exception that allows
  a facility that is exempt from the scoping requirement to install a
  limited-use/limited-application (LULA) elevator. LULA elevators are also
  permitted in the 1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards as an alternative to
  platform lifts. The 2010 Standards also add a new exception that permits
  private residence elevators in multi-story dwelling and transient lodging
  units. The 2010 Standards contain technical requirements for LULA elevators at
  section 408 and private residence elevators at section 409.

Section 407.2.1.4 of the
  2010 Standards includes an exception to the technical requirements for locating
  elevator call buttons for destination-oriented elevators. The advisory at
  section 407.2.1.4 describes lobby controls for destination-oriented elevator
  systems. Many elevator manufacturers have recently developed these new
  &quot;buttonless&quot; elevator control systems. These new, more efficient elevators are
  usually found in high-rise buildings that have several elevators. They require
  passengers to enter their destination floor on an entry device, usually a
  keypad, in the elevator lobby. The system then sends the most efficient car
  available to take all of the passengers going to the sixth floor, for example,
  only to the sixth floor, without making stops at the third, fourth, and fifth
  floors on the way to the sixth floor. The challenge for individuals who are
  blind or have low vision is how to know which elevator car to enter, after they
  have entered their destination floor into the keypad.

Commenters requested that
  the Department impose a moratorium on the installation of destination-oriented
  elevators arguing that this new technology presents wayfinding challenges for
  persons who are blind or have low vision.

Section 407.2.1.5 of the
  2010 Standards allows destination-oriented elevators to not provide call
  buttons with visible signals to indicate when each call is registered and when
  each call is answered *provided* that visible and audible
  signals, compliant with 407.2.2 of the 2010 Standards, indicating which
  elevator car to enter, are provided. This will require the responding elevator
  car to automatically provide audible and visible communication so that the
  system will always verbally and visually indicate which elevator car to enter.

As with any new
  technology, all users must have time to become acquainted with how to use
  destination-oriented elevators. The Department will monitor the use of this new
  technology and work with the Access Board so that there is not a decrease in
  accessibility as a result of permitting this new technology to be installed.

**Accessible Routes to Tiered Dining Areas in Sports Facilities.** The 1991 Standards, at sections
  4.1.3(1) and 5.4, and section 206.2.5 of the 2010 Standards require an
  accessible route to be provided to all dining areas in new construction,
  including raised or sunken dining areas. The 2010 Standards add a new exception
  for tiered dining areas in sports facilities. Dining areas in sports facilities are typically integrated
  into the seating bowl and are tiered to provide adequate lines of sight for
  individuals with disabilities. The new exception requires accessible routes to
  be provided to at least 25 percent (25%) of the tiered dining areas in sports
  facilities. Each tier must have the same services and the accessible routes
  must serve the accessible seating.

**Accessible Routes to Press Boxes.**  The 1991 Standards, at sections 4.1.1(1) and 4.1.3(1),
  cover all areas of newly constructed facilities required to be accessible, and
  require an accessible route to connect accessible entrances with all accessible
  spaces and elements within the facility. Section 201.1 of the 2010 Standards
  requires that all areas of newly designed and constructed buildings and
  facilities and altered portions of existing buildings and facilities be
  accessible. Sections 206.2.7(1) and (2) of the 2010 Standards add two
  exceptions that exempt small press boxes that are located in bleachers with
  entrances on only one level, and small press boxes that are free-standing
  structures elevated 12 feet or more above grade, from the accessible route
  requirement when the aggregate area of all press boxes in a sports facility
  does not exceed 500 square feet. The Department anticipates that this change
  will significantly reduce the economic impact on smaller sports facilities,
  such as those associated with high schools or community colleges.

**Public Entrances.**  The
  1991 Standards, at sections 4.1.3(8) and 4.1.6(1)(h), require at least fifty
  percent (50%) of public entrances to be accessible. Additionally, the 1991
  Standards require the number of accessible public entrances to be equivalent to
  the number of exits required by applicable building and fire codes. With very
  few exceptions, building and fire codes require at least two exits to be provided
  from spaces within a building and from the building itself. Therefore, under
  the 1991 Standards where two public entrances are planned in a newly
  constructed facility, both entrances are required to be accessible.

Instead of requiring
  accessible entrances based on the number of public entrances provided or the
  number of exits required (whichever is greater), section 206.4.1 of the 2010
  Standards requires at least sixty percent (60%) of public entrances to be
  accessible. The revision is intended to achieve the same result as the 1991
  Standards. Thus, under the 2010 Standards where two public entrances are
  planned in a newly constructed facility, both entrances must be accessible.

Where multiple public
  entrances are planned to serve different site arrival points, the 1991
  Standards, at section 4.1.2(1), and section 206.2.1 of the 2010 Standards
  require at least one accessible route to be provided from each type of site
  arrival point provided, including accessible parking spaces, accessible
  passenger loading zones, public streets and sidewalks, and public
  transportation stops, to an accessible public entrance that serves the site
  arrival point.

Commenters representing
  small businesses recommended retaining the 1991 requirement for fifty percent
  (50%) of public entrances of covered entities to be accessible. These
  commenters also raised concerns about the impact upon existing facilities of
  the new sixty percent (60%) requirement.

The Department believes
  that these commenters misunderstand the 1991 Standards. As explained above, the
  requirements of the 1991 Standards generally require more than fifty percent
  (50%) of entrances in small facilities to be accessible. Model codes require
  that most buildings have more than one means of egress. Most buildings have
  more than one entrance, and the requirements of the 1991 Standards typically
  resulted in these buildings having more than one accessible entrance. Requiring
  at least sixty percent (60%) of public entrances to be accessible is not
  expected to result in a substantial increase in the number of accessible
  entrances compared to the requirements of the 1991 Standards. In some very large facilities this
  change may result in fewer accessible entrances being required by the 2010
  Standards. However, the Department believes that the realities of good
  commercial design will result in more accessible entrances being provided for
  the convenience of all users.

The 1991 Standards and
  the 2010 Standards also contain exceptions that limit the number of accessible
  entrances required in alterations to existing facilities. When entrances to an
  existing facility are altered and the facility has an accessible entrance, the
  entrance being altered is not required to be accessible, unless a primary
  function area also is altered and then an accessible path of travel must be
  provided to the primary function area to the extent that the cost to do so is
  not disproportionate to the overall cost of the alteration.

**Alterations to Existing Elevators.** When a single space or element is altered, the 1991
  Standards, at sections 4.1.6(1)(a) and (b), require the space or element to be
  made accessible. When an element in one elevator is altered, the 2010
  Standards, at section 206.6.1, require the same element to be altered in all
  elevators that are programmed to respond to the same call button as the altered
  elevator.

The 2010 Standards, at
  sections 407.2.1 - 407.4.7.1.2, also contain exceptions to the technical
  requirements for elevators when existing elevators are altered that minimize the
  impact of this change.

Commenters expressed
  concerns about the requirement that when an element in one elevator is altered,
  the 2010 Standards, at section 206.6.1, will require the same element to be
  altered in all elevators that are programmed to respond to the same call button
  as the altered elevator. Commenters noted that such a requirement is burdensome
  and will result in costly efforts without significant benefit to individuals
  with disabilities.

The Department believes
  that this requirement is necessary to ensure that when an individual with a
  disability presses a call button, an accessible elevator will arrive. Without
  this requirement, individuals with disabilities would have to wait
  unnecessarily for an accessible elevator to make its way to them arbitrarily.
  The Department also believes that the effort required to meet this provision is
  minimal in the majority of situations because it is typical to upgrade all of
  the elevators in a bank at the same time.

**Accessible Routes in Dwelling Units with Mobility Features.** Sections 4.34.1 and 4.34.2 of the
  UFAS require the living area, kitchen and dining area, bedroom, bathroom, and
  laundry area, where provided, in covered dwelling units with mobility features
  to be on an accessible route. Where covered dwelling units have two or more
  bedrooms, at least two bedrooms are required to be on an accessible route.

The 2010 Standards at
  sections 233.3.1.1, 809.1, 809.2, 809.2.1, and 809.4 will require all spaces
  and elements within dwelling units with mobility features to be on an
  accessible route. These changes exempt unfinished attics and unfinished
  basements from the accessible route requirement. Section 233.3.5 of the 2010
  Standards also includes an exception to the dispersion requirement that permits
  accessible single-story dwelling units to be constructed, where multi-story
  dwelling units are one of the types of units provided.

**Location of Accessible Routes.**  Section 4.3.2(1) of the 1991 Standards requires accessible
  routes connecting site arrival points and accessible building entrances to
  coincide with general circulation paths, to the maximum extent feasible. The
  2010 Standards require all accessible routes to coincide with or be located in
  the same general area as general circulation paths. Additionally, a new
  provision specifies that where a circulation path is interior, the required
  accessible route must also be located in the interior of the facility. The change affects a limited number of
  buildings. Section 206.3 of the 2010 Standards requires all accessible routes
  to coincide with or be located in the same general area as general circulation
  paths. Designing newly constructed interior accessible routes to coincide with
  or to be located in the same area as general circulation paths will not typically
  present a difficult design challenge and is expected to impose limited design
  constraints. The change will have no impact on exterior accessible routes. The
  1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards also require accessible routes to be
  located in the interior of the facility where general circulation paths are
  located in the interior of the facility. The revision affects a limited number
  of buildings.

**Location of Accessible Routes to Stages.** The 1991 Standards at section 4.33.5 require an accessible route to connect the accessible seating and the performing area.

Section 206.2.6 of the 2010
  Standards requires the accessible route to directly connect the seating area
  and the accessible seating, stage, and all areas of the stage, where a
  circulation path directly connects the seating area and the stage. Both the
  1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards also require an accessible route to
  connect the stage and ancillary areas, such as dressing rooms, used by
  performers. The 2010 Standards do not require an additional accessible route to
  be provided to the stage. Rather, the changes specify where the accessible
  route to the stage, which is required by the 1991 Standards, must be located.

#### 207 Accessible Means of Egress

**General.** The 1991
  Standards at sections 4.1.3(9); 4.1.6(1)(g); and 4.3.10 establish scoping and
  technical requirements for accessible means of egress. Section 207.1 of the
  2010 Standards reference the International Building Code (IBC) for scoping and
  technical requirements for accessible means of egress.

The 1991 Standards
  require the same number of accessible means of egress to be provided as the
  number of exits required by applicable building and fire codes. The IBC
  requires at least one accessible means of egress and at least two accessible means
  of egress where more than one means of egress is required by other sections of
  the building code. The changes in the 2010 Standards are expected to have
  minimal impact since the model fire and life safety codes, which are adopted by
  all of the states, contain equivalent requirements with respect to the number
  of accessible means of egress.

The 1991 Standards
  require areas of rescue assistance or horizontal exits in facilities with
  levels above or below the level of exit discharge. Areas of rescue assistance
  are spaces that have direct access to an exit, stair, or enclosure where
  individuals who are unable to use stairs can go to call for assistance and wait
  for evacuation. The 2010 Standards incorporate the requirements established by
  the IBC. The IBC requires an evacuation elevator designed with standby power
  and other safety features that can be used for emergency evacuation of
  individuals with disabilities in facilities with four or more stories above or
  below the exit discharge level, and allows exit stairways and evacuation
  elevators to be used as an accessible means of egress in conjunction with areas
  of refuge or horizontal exits. The change is expected to have minimal impact
  since the model fire and life safety codes, adopted by most states, already
  contain parallel requirements with respect to evacuation elevators.

The 1991 Standards exempt
  facilities equipped with a supervised automatic sprinkler system from providing
  areas of rescue assistance, and also exempt alterations to existing facilities
  from providing an accessible means of egress. The IBC exempts buildings
  equipped with a supervised automatic sprinkler system from certain technical
  requirements for areas of refuge, and also exempts alterations to existing
  facilities from providing an accessible means of egress.

The 1991 and 2010
  Standards require signs that provide direction to or information about
  functional spaces to meet certain technical requirements. The 2010 Standards,
  at section 216.4, address exit signs. This section is consistent with the
  requirements of the IBC. Signs used for means of egress are covered by this
  scoping requirement. The requirements in the 2010 Standards require tactile
  signs complying with sections 703.1, 703.2 and 703.5 at doors at exit
  passageways, exit discharge, and at exit stairways. Directional exit signs and
  signs at areas of refuge required by section 216.4.3 must have visual
  characters and features complying with section 703.5.

**Standby Power for Platform Lifts.**  The 2010 Standards at section 207.2 require standby power
  to be provided for platform lifts that are permitted to serve as part of an
  accessible means of egress by the IBC. The IBC permits platform lifts to serve
  as part of an accessible means of egress in a limited number of places where platform
  lifts are allowed in new construction. The 1991 Standards, at 4.1.3 (5)
  Exception 4 (a) through (d), and the 2010 Standards, at sections 206.7.1
  through 206.7.10, similarly limit the places where platform lifts are allowed
  in new construction.

Commenters urged the
  Department to reconsider provisions that would require standby power to be
  provided for platform lifts. Concerns were raised that ensuring standby power
  would be too burdensome. The Department views this issue as a fundamental life
  safety issue. Lift users face the prospect of being trapped on the lift in the
  event of a power failure if standby power is not provided. The lack of standby
  power could be life-threatening in situations where the power failure is
  associated with a fire or other emergency. The use of a platform lift is
  generally only one of the options available to covered entities. Covered
  entities that are concerned about the costs associated with maintaining standby
  power for a lift may wish to explore design options that would incorporate the
  use of a ramp.

#### 208 and 502 Parking Spaces

**General.** Where parking
  spaces are provided, the 1991 Standards, at sections 4.1.2 (5)(a) and (7) and
  7(a), and the 2010 Standards, at section 208.1, require a specified number of
  the parking spaces to be accessible. The 2010 Standards, at section 208,
  include an exception that exempts parking spaces used exclusively for buses,
  trucks, delivery vehicles, law enforcement vehicles, or for purposes of
  vehicular impound, from the scoping requirement for parking spaces, provided
  that when these lots are accessed by the public the lot has an accessible
  passenger loading zone.

The 2010 Standards
  require accessible parking spaces to be identified by signs that display the
  International Symbol of Accessibility. Section 216.5, Exceptions 1 and 2, of
  the 2010 Standards exempt certain accessible parking spaces from this signage
  requirement. The first exception exempts sites that have four or fewer parking
  spaces from the signage requirement. Residential facilities where parking
  spaces are assigned to specific dwelling units are also exempted from the
  signage requirement.

Commenters stated that
  the first exception, by allowing a small parking lot with four or fewer spaces
  not to post a sign at its one accessible space, is problematic because it could
  allow all drivers to park in accessible parking spaces. The Department believes
  that this exception provides necessary relief for small business entities that
  may otherwise face the prospect of having between twenty-five percent (25%) and
  one hundred percent (100%) of their limited parking area unavailable to their
  customers because they are reserved for the exclusive use of persons whose
  vehicles display accessible tags or parking placards. The 2010 Standards still require
  these businesses to ensure that at least one of their available parking spaces
  is designed to be accessible.

A commenter stated that
  accessible parking spaces must be clearly marked. The Department notes that
  section 502.6 of the 2010 Standards provides that accessible parking spaces
  must be identified by signs that include the International Symbol of
  Accessibility. Also, section 502.3.3 of the 2010 Standards requires that access
  aisles be marked so as to discourage parking in them.

**Access Aisle.** Section
  502.3 of the 2010 Standards requires that an accessible route adjoin each
  access aisle serving accessible parking spaces. The accessible route connects
  each access aisle to accessible entrances.

Commenters questioned why
  the 2010 Standards would permit an accessible route used by individuals with
  disabilities to coincide with the path of moving vehicles. The Department
  believes that the 2010 Standards appropriately recognize that not all parking
  facilities provide separate pedestrian routes. Section 502.3 of the 2010
  Standards provides the flexibility necessary to permit designers and others to
  determine the most appropriate location of the accessible route to the
  accessible entrances. If all pedestrians using the parking facility are
  expected to share the vehicular lanes, then the ADA permits covered entities to
  use the vehicular lanes as part of the accessible route. The advisory note in
  section 502.3 of the 2010 Standards, however, calls attention to the fact that
  this practice, while permitted, is not ideal. Accessible parking spaces must be
  located on the shortest accessible route of travel to an accessible entrance.
  Accessible parking spaces and the required accessible route should be located
  where individuals with disabilities do not have to cross vehicular lanes or
  pass behind parked vehicles to have access to an accessible entrance. If it is
  necessary to cross a vehicular lane because, for example, local fire engine
  access requirements prohibit parking immediately adjacent to a building, then a
  marked crossing running perpendicular to the vehicular route should be included
  as part of the accessible route to an accessible entrance.

**Van Accessible Parking Spaces.** The 1991 Standards, at sections 4.1.2 (5)(b), 4.6.3, 4.6.4,
  and 4.6.5, require one in every eight accessible parking spaces to be van
  accessible. Section 208.2.4 of the 2010 Standards requires one in every six
  accessible parking spaces to be van accessible.

A commenter asked whether
  automobiles other than vans may park in van accessible parking spaces. The 2010
  Standards do not prohibit automobiles other than vans from using van accessible
  parking spaces. The Department does not distinguish between vehicles that are
  actual &quot;vans&quot; versus other vehicles such as trucks, station wagons, sport
  utility vehicles, etc. since many vehicles other than vans may be used by
  individuals with disabilities to transport mobility devices.

Commenters&acute; opinions were
  divided on this point. Facility operators and others asked for a reduction in
  the number of required accessible parking spaces, especially the number of van
  accessible parking spaces, because they claimed these spaces often are not
  used. Individuals with disabilities, however, requested an increase in the
  scoping requirements for these parking spaces.

The Department is aware
  that a strong difference of opinion exists between those who use such spaces
  and those who must provide or maintain them. Therefore, the Department did not
  increase the total number of accessible spaces required. The only change was to
  increase the proportion of spaces that must be accessible to vans and other
  vehicles equipped to transport mobility devices.

**Direct Access Entrances from Parking Structures.**  Where levels in a parking garage have direct connections for
  pedestrians to another facility, the 1991 Standards, at section 4.1.3(8)(b)(i),
  require at least one of the direct connections to be accessible. The 2010
  Standards, at section 206.4.2, require all of these direct connections to be
  accessible.

#### 209 and 503 Passenger Loading Zones and Bus Stops

**Passenger Loading Zones at Medical Care and Long-Term Care Facilities.** Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the 1991
  Standards and section 209.3 of the 2010 Standards require medical care and
  long-term care facilities, where the period of stay exceeds 24 hours, to
  provide at least one accessible passenger loading zone at an accessible
  entrance. The 1991 Standards also require a canopy or roof overhang at this
  passenger loading zone. The 2010 Standards do not require a canopy or roof
  overhang.

Commenters urged the
  Department to reinstate the requirement for a canopy or roof overhang at
  accessible passenger loading zones at medical care and long-term care
  facilities. While the Department recognizes that a canopy or roof overhang may afford
  useful protection from inclement weather conditions to everyone using a
  facility, it is not clear that the absence of such protection would impede
  access by individuals with disabilities. Therefore, the Department declined to
  reinstate that requirement.

**Passenger Loading Zones.** Where
  passenger loading zones are provided, the 1991 Standards, at sections 4.1.2(5)
  and 4.6.6, require at least one passenger loading zone to be accessible.
  Sections 209.2.1 and 503 of the 2010 Standards, require facilities such as
  airport passenger terminals that have long, continuous passenger loading zones
  to provide one accessible passenger loading zone in every continuous 100 linear
  feet of loading zone space. The 1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards both
  include technical requirements for the vehicle pull-up space (96 inches wide
  minimum and 20 feet long minimum). Accessible passenger loading zones must have
  an access aisle that is 60 inches wide minimum and extends the full length of
  the vehicle pull-up space. The 1991 Standards permit the access aisle to be on
  the same level as the vehicle pull-up space, or on the sidewalk. The 2010
  Standards require the access aisle to be on the same level as the vehicle
  pull-up space and to be marked so as to discourage parking in the access aisle.

Commenters expressed
  concern that certain covered entities, particularly airports, cannot
  accommodate the requirements of the 2010 Standards to provide passenger loading
  zones, and urged a revision that would require one accessible passenger loading
  zone located in reasonable proximity to each building entrance served by the
  curb.

Commenters raised a
  variety of issues about the requirements at section 503 of the 2010 Standards
  stating that the requirements for an access aisle, width, length, and marking
  of passenger loading zones are not clear, do not fully meet the needs of
  individuals with disabilities, may run afoul of state or local requirements, or
  may not be needed because many passenger loading zones are typically staffed by
  doormen or valet parkers. The wide range of opinions expressed in these
  comments indicates that this provision is controversial. However, none of these
  comments provided sufficient data to enable the Department to determine that
  the requirement is not appropriate.

**Valet Parking and Mechanical Access Parking Garages.** The 1991 Standards, at sections
  4.1.2(5)(a) and (e), and sections 208.2, 209.4, and 209.5 of the 2010 Standards
  require parking facilities that provide valet parking services to have an
  accessible passenger loading zone. The 2010 Standards extend this requirement
  to mechanical access parking garages. The 1991 Standards contained an exception
  that exempted valet parking facilities from providing accessible parking
  spaces. The 2010 Standards eliminate this exception. The reason for not
  retaining the provision is that valet parking is a service, not a facility
  type.

Commenters questioned why
  the exception for valet parking facilities from providing accessible parking
  spaces was eliminated. The provision was eliminated because valet parkers may
  not have the skills necessary to drive a vehicle that is equipped to be
  accessible, including use of hand controls, or when a seat is not present to
  accommodate a driver using a wheelchair. In that case, permitting the
  individual with a disability to self-park may be a required reasonable
  modification of policy by a covered entity.

#### 210 and 504 Stairways

The 1991 Standards
  require stairs to be accessible only when they provide access to floor levels
  not otherwise connected by an accessible route (*e.g.*, where the accessible route is provided by an
  elevator, lift, or ramp). The 2010 Standards, at sections 210.1 and 504,
  require all *newly constructed stairs* that are part of a *means of egress* to comply with the requirements for accessible stairs, which include
  requirements for accessible treads, risers, and handrails. In existing
  facilities, where floor levels are connected by an accessible route, only the
  handrail requirement will apply when the stairs are altered. Exception 2 to
  section 210.1 of the 2010 Standards permits altered stairs to not comply with
  the requirements for accessible treads and risers where there is an accessible
  route between floors served by the stairs.

Most commenters were in
  favor of this requirement for handrails in alterations and stated that adding
  handrails to stairs during alterations would be feasible and not costly while
  providing important safety benefits. The Department believes that it strikes an
  appropriate balance by focusing the expanded requirements on new construction.
  The 2010 Standards apply to stairs which are part of a required means of
  egress. Few stairways are not part of a means of egress. The 2010 Standards are
  consistent with most building codes which do not exempt stairways when the
  route is also served by a ramp or elevator.

#### 211 and 602 Drinking Fountains

Sections 4.1.3(10) and 4.15 of the 1991 Standards and sections 211 and 602 of the 2010 Standards
  require drinking fountains to be provided for persons who use wheelchairs and
  for others who stand. The 1991 Standards require wall and post-mounted
  cantilevered drinking fountains mounted at a height for wheelchair users to
  provide clear floor space for a forward approach with knee and toe clearance
  and free standing or built-in drinking fountains to provide clear floor space
  for a parallel approach. The 2010 Standards require drinking fountains mounted
  at a height for wheelchair users to provide clear floor space for a forward
  approach with knee and toe clearance, and include an exception for a parallel
  approach for drinking fountains installed at a height to accommodate very small
  children. The 2010 Standards also include a technical requirement for drinking
  fountains for standing persons.

#### 212 and 606 Kitchens, Kitchenettes, Lavatories, and Sinks

The 1991 Standards, at sections 4.24, and 9.2.2(7), contain technical requirements for sinks and only
  have specific scoping requirements for sinks in transient lodging. Section
  212.3 of the 2010 Standards requires at least five percent (5%) of sinks in
  each accessible space to comply with the technical requirements for sinks. The
  technical requirements address clear floor space, height, faucets, and exposed
  pipes and surfaces. The 1991 Standards, at section 4.24, and the 2010 Standards,
  at section 606, both require the clear floor space at sinks to be positioned
  for a forward approach and knee and toe clearance to be provided under the
  sink. The 1991 Standards, at section 9.2.2(7), allow the clear floor space at
  kitchen sinks and wet bars in transient lodging guest rooms with mobility
  features to be positioned for either a forward approach with knee and toe
  clearance or for a parallel approach.

The 2010 Standards
  include an exception that permits the clear floor space to be positioned for a
  parallel approach at kitchen sinks in any space where a cook top or
  conventional range is not provided, and at a wet bar.

A commenter stated that
  it is unclear what the difference is between a sink and a lavatory, and that
  this is complicated by requirements that apply to sinks (five percent (5%)
  accessible) and lavatories (at least one accessible). The term &quot;lavatory&quot;
  generally refers to the specific type of plumbing fixture required for hand
  washing in toilet and bathing facilities. The more generic term &quot;sink&quot; applies
  to all other types of sinks located in covered facilities.

A commenter recommended
  that the mounting height of sinks and lavatories should take into consideration
  the increased use of three-wheeled scooters and some larger wheelchairs. The
  Department is aware that the use of three-wheeled scooters and larger
  wheelchairs may be increasing and that some of these devices may require
  changes in space requirements in the future. The Access Board is funding
  research to obtain data that may be used to develop design guidelines that
  provide access to individuals using these mobility devices.

#### 213, 603, 604, and 608 Toilet and Bathing Facilities, Rooms, and Compartments

**General.**  Where toilet facilities and bathing facilities are provided, they must comply with section
  213 of the 2010 Standards.

A commenter recommended
  that all accessible toilet facilities, toilet rooms, and compartments should be
  required to have signage indicating that such spaces are restricted solely for
  the use of individuals with disabilities. The Department believes that it is
  neither necessary nor appropriate to restrict the use of accessible toilet
  facilities. Like many other facilities designed to be accessible, accessible
  toilet facilities can and do serve a wide range of individuals with and without
  disabilities.

A commenter recommended
  that more than one wheelchair accessible compartment be provided in toilet
  rooms serving airports and train stations because these compartments are likely
  to be occupied by individuals with luggage and persons with disabilities often
  take longer to use them. The Access Board is examining airport terminal
  accessibility as part of an ongoing effort to facilitate accessibility and
  promote effective design. As part of these efforts, the Access Board will
  examine requirements for accessible toilet compartments in larger airport
  restrooms. The Department declines to change the scoping for accessible toilet
  compartments at this time.

**Ambulatory Accessible Toilet Compartments.**  Section 213.3.1 of the 2010 Standards requires multi-user
  men&acute;s toilet rooms, where the total of toilet compartments and urinals is six
  or more, to contain at least one ambulatory accessible compartment. The 1991
  Standards count only toilet stalls (compartments) for this purpose. The 2010
  Standards establish parity between multi-user women&acute;s toilet rooms and
  multi-user men&acute;s toilet rooms with respect to ambulatory accessible toilet
  compartments.

**Urinals.**  Men&acute;s toilet
  rooms with only one urinal will no longer be required to provide an accessible
  urinal under the 2010 Standards. Such toilet rooms will still be required to
  provide an accessible toilet compartment. Commenters urged that the
  exception be eliminated. The Department believes that this change will provide
  flexibility to many small businesses and it does not alter the requirement that
  all common use restrooms must be accessible.

**Multiple Single-User Toilet Rooms.**  Where multiple single-user toilet rooms are clustered in a
  single location, fifty percent (50%), rather than the one hundred percent
  (100%) required by the 1991 Standards, are required to be accessible by section
  213.2, Exception 4 of the 2010 Standards. Section 216.8 of the 2010 Standards
  requires that accessible single-user toilet rooms must be identified by the
  International Symbol of Accessibility where all single-user toilet rooms are
  not accessible.

**Hospital Patient Toilet Rooms.** An exception was added in section 223.1 of the 2010
  Standards to allow toilet rooms that are part of critical or intensive care
  patient sleeping rooms to no longer be required to provide mobility features.

**Water Closet Location and Rear Grab Bar.**  Section 604.2 of the 2010 Standards allows greater
  flexibility for the placement of the centerline of wheelchair accessible and
  ambulatory accessible water closets. Section 604.5.2, Exception 1 permits a
  shorter grab bar on the rear wall where there is not enough wall space due to
  special circumstances (e.g., when a lavatory or other recessed fixture is located
  next to the water closet and the wall behind the lavatory is recessed so that
  the lavatory does not overlap the required clear floor space at the water
  closet). The 1991 Standards contain no exception for grab bar length, and
  require the water closet centerline to be exactly 18 inches from the side wall,
  while the 2010 Standards requirement allows the centerline to be between 16 and
  18 inches from the side wall in wheelchair accessible toilet compartments and
  17 to 19 inches in ambulatory accessible toilet compartments.

**Water Closet Clearance.** Section
  604.3 of the 2010 Standards represents a change in the accessibility
  requirements where a lavatory is installed adjacent to the water closet. The
  1991 Standards allow the nearest side of a lavatory to be placed 18 inches
  minimum from the water closet centerline and 36 inches minimum from the side
  wall adjacent to the water closet. However, locating the lavatory so close to
  the water closet prohibits many individuals with disabilities from using a side
  transfer. To allow greater transfer options, including side transfers, the 2010
  Standards prohibit lavatories from overlapping the clear floor space at water
  closets, except in covered residential dwelling units.

A majority of commenters,
  including persons who use wheelchairs, strongly agreed with the requirement to
  provide enough space for a side transfer. These commenters believed that the
  requirement will increase the usability of accessible single-user toilet rooms
  by making side transfers possible for many individuals who use wheelchairs and
  would have been unable to transfer to a water closet using a side transfer even
  if the water closet complied with the 1991 Standards. In addition, many
  commenters noted that the additional clear floor space at the side of the water
  closet is also critical for those providing assistance with transfers and
  personal care for persons with disabilities. Numerous comments noted that this
  requirement is already included in other model accessibility standards and many
  state and local building codes and its adoption in the 2010 Standards is a
  important part of harmonization efforts. The Department agrees that the
  provision of enough clear floor space to permit side transfers at water closets
  is an important feature that must be provided to ensure access for persons with
  disabilities in toilet and bathing facilities. Furthermore, the adoption of
  this requirement closely harmonizes with the model codes and many state and
  local building codes.

Other commenters urged
  the Department not to adopt section 604.3 of the 2010 Standards claiming that
  it will require single-user toilet rooms to be two feet wider than the 1991
  Standards require, and this additional requirement will be difficult to meet.
  Multiple commentators also expressed concern that the size of single-user
  toilet rooms would be increased but they did not specify how much larger such
  toilet rooms would have to be in their estimation. In response to these
  concerns, the Department developed a series of single-user toilet room floor
  plans demonstrating that the total square footage between representative
  layouts complying with the 1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards are
  comparable. The Department believes the floor plan comparisons clearly show
  that size differences between the two Standards are not substantial and several
  of the 2010 Standards-compliant plans do not require additional square footage
  compared to the 1991 Standards plans. These single-user toilet room floor plans
  are shown below.

Several commenters
  concluded that alterations of single-user toilet rooms should be exempt from
  the requirements of section 604.3 of the 2010 Standards because of the
  significant reconfiguration and reconstruction that would be required, such as
  moving plumbing fixtures, walls, and/or doors at significant additional
  expense. The Department disagrees with this conclusion since it fails to take
  into account several key points. The 2010 Standards contain provisions for
  in-swinging doors, 603.2.3, Exception 2, and recessed fixtures adjacent to
  water closets, 604.5.2, Exception 1. These provisions give flexibility to
  create more compact room designs and maintain required clearances around
  fixtures. As with the 1991 Standards, any alterations must comply to the extent
  that it is technically feasible to do so.

The requirements at
  section 604.3.2 of the 2010 Standards specify how required clearance around the
  water closet can overlap with specific elements and spaces. An exception that
  applies only to covered residential dwelling units permits a lavatory to be
  located no closer than 18 inches from the centerline of the water closet. The
  requirements at section 604.3.2 of the 2010 Standards increase accessibility
  for individuals with disabilities. One commenter expressed concern about other
  items that might overlap the clear floor space, such as dispensers, shelves,
  and coat hooks on the side of the water closet where a wheelchair would be
  positioned for a transfer. Section 604.3.2 of the 2010 Standards allows items
  such as associated grab bars, dispensers, sanitary napkin disposal units, coat
  hooks, and shelves to overlap the clear floor space. These are items that
  typically do not affect the usability of the clear floor space.

**Toilet Room Doors.** Sections
  4.22.2 and 4.22.3 of the 1991 Standards and Section 603.2.3 of the 2010
  Standards permit the doors of all toilet or bathing rooms with in-swinging
  doors to swing into the required turning space, but not into the clear floor
  space required at any fixture. In single-user toilet rooms or bathing rooms,
  Section 603.2.3 Exception 2 of the 2010 Standards permits the door to swing
  into the clear floor space of an accessible fixture if a clear floor space that
  measures at least 30 inches by 48 inches is provided outside of the door swing.

Several commenters
  expressed reservations about Exception 2 of Section 603.2.3. Concerns were
  raised that permitting doors of single-user toilet or bathing rooms with
  in-swinging doors to swing into the clearance around any fixture will result in
  inaccessibility to individuals using larger wheelchairs and scooters.
  Additionally, a commenter stated that the exception would require an
  unacceptable amount of precision maneuvering by individuals who use standard
  size wheelchairs. The Department believes that this provision achieves
  necessary flexibility while providing a minimum standard for maneuvering space.
  The standard does permit additional maneuvering space to be provided, if
  needed.

In the NPRM, the
  Department provided a series of plan drawings illustrating comparisons of the
  minimum size single-user toilet rooms. These floor plans showed typical
  examples that met the minimum
  requirements of the proposed ADA Standards. A commenter was of the opinion that
  the single-user toilet plans shown in the NPRM demonstrated that the new
  requirements will not result in a substantial increase in room size. Several
  other commenters representing industry offered criticisms of the single-user
  toilet floor plans to support their assertion that a 2010 Standards-compliant
  single-user toilet room will never be smaller and will likely be larger than
  such a toilet room required under the 1991 Standards. Commenters also asserted
  that the floor plans prepared by the Department were of a very basic design
  which could be accommodated in a minimal sized space whereas the types of
  facilities their customers demand would require additional space to be added to
  the rooms shown in the floor plans. The Department recognizes that there are
  many design choices that can affect the size of a room or space. Choices to
  install additional features may result in more space being needed to provide
  sufficient clear floor space for that additional feature to comply. However,
  many facilities that have these extra features also tend to have ample space to
  meet accessibility requirements. Other commenters asserted that public
  single-user toilet rooms always include a closer and a latch on the entry door,
  requiring a larger clear floor space than shown on the push side of the door
  shown in Plan 1B. The Department acknowledges that in instances where a latch
  is provided and a closer is required by other regulations or codes, the minimum
  size of a room with an out-swinging door may be slightly larger than as shown
  in Plan 1C.

Additional floor plans of
  single-user toilet rooms are now included in further response to the commentary
  received.

<strong>Plan-1A: 1991 Standards Minimum with Out-Swinging Door - 5’-0” x 7’-3” 36.25 Square Feet:</strong>  This plan shows a typical example of a single-user toilet room that meets the minimum requirements of the 1991 Standards. The size of this space is determined by the minimum width required for the water closet and lavatory between the side walls, the minimum wheelchair turning space, and the space required for the out-swinging door. A lavatory with knee space can overlap the clear floor space required for the water closet provided that at least 36 inches of clearance is maintained between the side wall next to the water closet and the lavatory (see section 4.16.2 and Fig. 28 of the 1991 Standards). A wheelchair turning space meeting section 4.2.3 of the 1991 Standards must be provided. The size of this room requires that the entry door swing out. The room would be larger if the door were in-swinging.
{% endfigcaption %}

<strong>Plan-1B: 2010 Standards Minimum with Out-Swinging Door - 7’-0” x 5’-0” 35.00 Square Feet</strong>:  This plan shows a typical example of a single-user toilet room that meets the minimum requirements of the 2010 Standards. Features include: five-foot minimum width between the side wall of the water closet and the lavatory; 60-inch minimum circular wheelchair turning space; and 36-inch by 48-inch clear maneuvering space for the out-swinging entry door. Section 604.3.1 of the 2010 Standards requires a floor clearance at a water closet that is a minimum of 60 inches wide by 56 inches deep regardless of approach. Section 604.3.2 prohibits any other plumbing fixtures from being located in this clear space, except in residential dwelling units. The 2010 Standards, at section 304.3, allows the turning space to extend into toe and knee space provided beneath fixtures and other elements. Required maneuvering space for the entry door (inside the room) must be clear of all fixtures. If the door had both a closer and latch, section 404.2.4.1 and Figure 404.2.4.1(c) require additional space on the latch side.  This layout is three point five percent (3.5%) smaller than the accompanying Plan-1A: 1991 Standards Minimum with Out-Swinging Door example.

<strong>Plan-1C: 2010 Standards Minimum with Out-Swinging Door (entry door has both closer and latch)- 7’-0” x 5’-6” 38.50 Square Feet:</strong>  This plan shows the same typical features of a single-user toilet room that meets the minimum requirements of the 2010 Standards as Plan-1B does except the entry door has both a closer and latch. Because the door has both a closer and latch, a minimum additional foot of maneuvering space is required on the latch side (see section 404.2.4.1 and Figure 404.2.4.1(c) of the 2010 Standards).

Depending on the width of the hallway and other circulation issues, it can be preferable to swing the entry door into the toilet room. Businesses and public entities typically prefer to have an in-swinging door. The in-swinging door increases overall room size because it cannot swing over the required clear floor space at any accessible fixture, (see section 4.22.2 of the 1991 Standards). This increases the room depth from Plan-1A. The door is permitted to swing over the required turning space shown as a 60-inch circle.

In the 2010 Standards an exception allows the entry door to swing over the clear floor spaces and clearances required at the fixtures if a clear floor space complying with section 305.3 (minimum 30 inches by 48 inches) is provided outside the arc of the door swing, section 603.2.3 exception 2. The required maneuvering space for the door, section 404.2.4.1 and Figure 404.2.4.1(a), also is a factor in room size. This clear space cannot be obstructed by the plumbing fixtures. Note that this layout provides more space for turning when the door is closed than Plan-1B.

{% endfigure %}

**Toilet Paper Dispensers.**  The provisions for toilet paper dispensers at section 604.7 of the 2010 Standards
  require the dispenser to be located seven inches minimum and nine inches
  maximum in front of the water closet measured to the centerline of the
  dispenser. The paper outlet of the dispenser must be located 15 inches minimum
  and 48 inches maximum above the finish floor. In the 1991 Standards the
  location of the toilet paper dispenser is determined by the centerline and
  forward edge of the dispenser. In the 2010 Standards the mounting location of
  the toilet paper dispenser is determined by the centerline of the dispenser and
  the location of the outlet for the toilet paper.

One commenter discussed
  the difficulty of using large roll toilet paper dispensers and dispensers with
  two standard size rolls stacked on top of each other. The size of the large
  dispensers can block access to the grab bar and the outlet for the toilet paper
  can be too low or too high to be usable. Some dispensers also control the
  delivery of the toilet paper which can make it impossible to get the toilet
  paper. Toilet paper dispensers that control delivery or do not allow continuous
  paper flow are not permitted by the 1991 Standards or the 2010 Standards. Also,
  many of the large roll toilet paper dispensers do not comply with the 2010
  Standards since their large size does not allow them to be mounted 12 inches
  above or 1 1/2 inches below the side grab bar as required by section 609.3.

**Shower Spray Controls.**&nbsp; In
  accessible bathtubs and shower compartments, sections 607.6 and 608.6 of the
  2010 Standards require shower spray controls to have an on/off control and to
  deliver water that is 120&iexcl;F (49&iexcl;C) maximum. Neither feature was required by the
  1991 Standards, but may be required by plumbing codes. Delivering water that is
  no hotter than 120&iexcl;F (49&iexcl;C) will require controlling the maximum temperature at
  each accessible shower spray unit.

**Shower Compartments.&nbsp;** The
  1991 Standards at sections 4.21 and 9.1.2 and the 2010 Standards at section 608
  contain technical requirements for transfer-type and roll-in shower
  compartments. The 2010 Standards provide more flexibility than the 1991
  Standards as follows:

- Transfer-type showers are exactly 36
inches wide by 36 inches long.
- The 1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards
permit a 1/2-inch maximum curb in transfer-type showers. The 2010 Standards add
a new exception that permits a 2-inch maximum curb in transfer-type showers in
alterations to existing facilities, where recessing the compartment to achieve
a 1/2-inch curb will disturb the structural reinforcement of the floor slab.
- Roll-in showers are 30 inches wide minimum by 60 inches long minimum. Alternate roll-in showers are 36 inches wide
by 60 inches long minimum, and have a 36-inch minimum wide opening on the long
side of the compartment. The 1991 Standards require alternate roll-in showers
in a portion of accessible transient lodging guest rooms, but provision of this
shower type in other facilities is generally permitted as an equivalent
facilitation. The 1991 Standards require a seat to be provided adjacent to the
opening; and require the controls to be located on the side adjacent to the
seat. The 2010 Standards permit alternate roll-in showers to be used in any
facility, only require a seat in transient lodging guest rooms, and allow
location of controls on the back wall opposite the seat as an alternative.

Commenters raised
  concerns that adding a new exception that permits a 2-inch maximum curb in
  transfer-type showers in alterations to existing facilities, where recessing
  the compartment to achieve a 1/2-inch curb will disturb the structural
  reinforcement of the floor slab, will impair the ability of individuals with
  disabilities to use transfer-type showers.

The exception in section
  608.7 of the 2010 Standards permitting a 2-inch maximum curb in transfer-type
  showers is allowed only in existing facilities where provision of a 1/2-inch
  high threshold would disturb the structural reinforcement of the floor slab.
  Whenever this exception is used the least high threshold that can be used
  should be provided, up to a maximum height of 2 inches. This exception is
  intended to provide some flexibility where the existing structure precludes
  full compliance.

**Toilet and Bathing Rooms.**&nbsp; Section
  213 of the 2010 Standards sets out the scoping requirements for toilet and
  bathing rooms.

Commenters recommended
  that section 213, Toilet Facilities and Bathing Facilities, of the 2010
  Standards include requirements that unisex toilet and bathing rooms be provided
  in certain facilities. These commenters suggested that unisex toilet and
  bathing rooms are most useful as companion care facilities.

Model plumbing and building
  codes require single-user (unisex or family) toilet facilities in certain
  occupancies, primarily assembly facilities, covered malls, and transportation
  facilities. These types of toilet rooms provide flexibility for persons needing
  privacy so that they can obtain assistance from family members or persons of
  the opposite sex. When these facilities are provided, both the 1991 Standards
  and 2010 Standards require that they be accessible. The 2010 Standards do not
  scope unisex toilet facilities because plumbing codes generally determine the
  number and type of plumbing fixtures to be provided in a particular occupancy
  and often determine whether an occupancy must provide separate sex facilities
  in addition to single-user facilities. However, the scoping at section 213.2.1
  of the 2010 Standards coordinates with model plumbing and building code
  requirements which will permit a small toilet room with two water closets or
  one water closet and one urinal to be considered a single-user toilet room
  provided that the room has a privacy latch. In this way, a person needing
  assistance from a person of the opposite sex can lock the door to use the
  facility while temporarily inconveniencing only one other potential user. These
  provisions strike a reasonable balance and impose less impact on covered
  entities.

A commenter recommended
  that in shower compartments rectangular seats as provided in section 610.3.1 of
  the 2010 Standards should not be permitted as a substitute for L-shaped seats
  as provided in 610.3.2.
The 2010 Standards do not
  indicate a preference for either rectangular or L-shaped seats in shower
  compartments. L-shaped seats in transfer and certain roll-in showers have been
  used for many years to provide users with poor balance additional support
  because they can position themselves in the corner while showering.

#### 214 and 611 Washing Machines and Clothes Dryers

Sections 214.2 (washing
  machines) and 214.3 (clothes dryers) of the 2010 Standards specify the number
  of each type of these machines required to be accessible (one to two depending
  upon the total number of machines provided) and section 611 specifies the
  technical requirements. An exception will permit the maximum height for the
  tops of these machines to be 2 inches higher than the general requirement for
  maximum high reach over an obstruction.

A commenter objected to
  the scoping provision for accessible washing machines and clothes dryers
  stating that the probability is low that more than one accessible machine would
  be needed at the same time in the laundry facility of a place of transient
  lodging.

The scoping in this
  provision is based on the relative size of the facility. The Department assumes
  that the size of the facility (and, therefore, the number of accessible
  machines provided) will be determined by the covered entity&acute;s assessment of the
  demand for laundry facilities. The Department declines to assume that persons
  with disabilities will have less use for accessible facilities in transient
  lodging than in other public accommodations.

#### 216 and 703 Signs

The following types of
  signs, though they are not specifically subject to the 1991 Standards
  requirement for signs, will now be explicitly exempted by sections 216 and 703
  of the 2010 Standards. These types of signs include: seat and row designations
  in assembly areas; occupant names, building addresses; company names and logos;
  signs in parking facilities (except those identifying accessible parking spaces
  and means of egress); and exterior signs identifying permanent rooms and spaces
  that are not located at the door to the space they serve. This requirement also
  clarifies that the exception for temporary signs applies to signs used for
  seven days or less.

The 2010 Standards retain
  the option to provide one sign where both visual and tactile characters are
  provided or two signs, one with visual, and one with tactile characters.

#### 217 and 704 Telephones

**Drive-up Public Telephones.**&nbsp; Where
  public telephones are provided, the 1991 Standards, at section 4.1.3(17)(a),
  and section 217.2 of the 2010 Standards, require a certain number of telephones
  to be wheelchair accessible. The 2010 Standards add a new exception that
  exempts drive-up public telephones.

**Text Telephones (TTY).&nbsp;**&nbsp; Section 4.1.3(17) of the 1991 Standards requires a public TTY to be provided
  if there are four or more public pay telephones at a site and at least one is
  in an interior location. Section 217.4.2 of the 2010 Standards requires that a
  building or facility provide a public TTY on each floor that has four or more
  public telephones, and in each telephone bank that has four or more telephones.
  Additionally, section 217.4.4 of the 2010 Standards requires that at least one
  public TTY be installed where four or more public pay telephones are provided
  on an exterior site. Section 217.4.5 of the 2010 Standards also requires that a
  public TTY be provided where at least one public pay telephone is provided at a
  public rest stop, emergency roadside stop, or service plaza. Section 217.4.6 of
  the 2010 Standards also requires that a public TTY be provided at each location
  where at least one public pay telephone is provided serving a hospital
  emergency room, a hospital recovery room, or a hospital waiting room. Section
  217.4.7 of the 2010 Standards also requires that, in addition to the requirements
  for a public TTY to be provided at each location where at least four or more
  public pay telephones are provided at a bank of pay telephones and where at
  least one public pay telephone is provided on a floor or in a public building,
  where at least one public pay telephone serves a particular entrance to a bus
  or rail facility at least one public TTY must serve that entrance. In airports,
  in addition to the requirements for the provision of a public TTY at phone
  banks, on floors, and in public buildings with pay phones, where four or more
  public pay phones are located in a terminal outside the security areas, in a
  concourse within the security areas, or a baggage claim area in a terminal at
  least one public TTY must be provided. Section 217.4.8 of the 2010 Standards
  also requires that a TTY be provided in at least one secured area where at
  least one pay telephone is provided in a secured area used only by detainees or
  inmates and security personnel in detention and correctional facilities.

#### Wheelchair Accessible Telephones

Section 217.2 of the 2010
  Standards requires that where public telephones are provided wheelchair
  accessible telephones complying with section 704.2 must be provided in
  accordance with Table 217.2.

  A commenter stated that
  requiring installation of telephones within the proposed reach range
  requirements would adversely impact public and telephone owners and operators.
  According to the commenter, individuals without disabilities will not use
  telephones that are installed within the reach range requirements because they
  may be inconvenienced by having to stoop to operate these telephones, and,
  therefore, owners and operators will lose revenue due to less use of public
  telephones.

This comment
  misunderstands the scoping requirements for wheelchair accessible
  telephones.&nbsp; Section 217.2 of the
  2010 Standards provides that where one or more single units are provided, only
  one unit per floor, level, or exterior site is required to be wheelchair
  accessible. However, where banks of telephones are provided, only one telephone
  in each bank is required to be wheelchair accessible. The Department believes
  these scoping requirements for wheelchair accessible telephones are reasonable
  and will not result in burdensome obligations or lost revenue for owners and
  operators.

#### 218 and 810 Transportation Facilities

**Detectable Warnings.&nbsp;** Detectable
  warnings provide a distinctively textured surface of truncated domes. The 1991
  Standards at sections 4.1.3(15), 4.7.7, 4.29.2, 4.29.5, 4.29.6, and 10.3.1(8) require
  detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, reflecting pools,
  and transit platform edges. The 2010 Standards at sections 218, 810.5, 705.1,
  and 705.2 only require detectable warnings at transit platform edges. The
  technical specifications for the diameter and spacing of the truncated domes
  have also been changed. The 2010 Standards also delete the requirement for the
  material used to contrast in resiliency or sound-on-cane contact from adjoining
  walking surfaces at interior locations.

The 2010 Standards apply
  to detectable warnings on developed sites. They do not apply to the public
  right-of-way. Scoping for detectable warnings at all locations other than
  transit platform edges has been eliminated from the 2010 Standards. However, because
  detectable warnings have been shown to significantly benefit individuals with
  disabilities at transit platform edges, the 2010 Standards provide scoping and
  technical requirements for detectable warnings at transit platform edges.

#### 219 and 706 Assistive Listening Systems

**Signs.**&nbsp; Section 216.10 of the 2010
  Standards requires each covered assembly area to provide signs at each
  auditorium to inform patrons that assistive listening systems are available.
  However, an exception to this requirement permits assembly areas that have
  ticket offices or ticket windows to display the required signs at the ticket
  window.

A commenter recommended
  eliminating the exception at 216.10 because, for example, people who buy
  tickets through the mail, by subscription, or on-line may not need to stop at a
  ticket office or window upon arrival at the assembly area. The Department
  believes that an individual&acute;s decision to purchase tickets before arriving at a
  performance does not limit the discretion of the assembly operator to use the
  ticket window to provide other services to its patrons. The Department retained
  the exception at 216.10 to permit the venue operator some flexibility in
  determining how to meet the needs of its patrons.

**Audible Communication.&nbsp;**&nbsp; The 1991 Standards, at section 4.1.3(19)(b), require assembly areas,
  where audible communication is integral to the use of the space, to provide an
  assistive listening system if they have an audio amplification system or an
  occupant load of 50 or more people and have fixed seating. The 2010 Standards
  at section 219 require assistive listening systems in spaces where
  communication is integral to the space and audio amplification is provided and
  in courtrooms.

The 1991 Standards
  require receivers to be provided for at least four percent (4%) of the total
  number of fixed seats. The 2010 Standards, at section 219.3, revise the
  percentage of receivers required according to a table that correlates the
  required number of receivers to the seating capacity of the facility. Small facilities
  will continue to provide receivers for four percent (4%) of the seats. The
  required percentage declines as the size of the facility increases. The changes
  also require at least twenty-five percent (25%), but no fewer than two, of the
  receivers to be hearing-aid compatible. Assembly areas served by an induction
  loop assistive listening system will not have to provide hearing-aid compatible
  receivers.

Commenters were divided
  in their opinion of this change. The Department believes that the reduction in
  the required number of assistive listening systems for larger assembly areas
  will meet the needs of individuals with disabilities. The new requirement to
  provide hearing-aid compatible receivers should make assistive listening
  systems more usable for people who have been underserved until now.

Concerns were raised that
  the requirement to provide assistive listening systems may have an adverse
  impact on restaurants. This comment misunderstands the scope of coverage. The
  2010 Standards define the term &quot;assembly area&quot; to include facilities used for
  entertainment, educational, or civic gatherings. A restaurant would fall within
  this category only if it is presenting programs to educate or entertain diners,
  and it provides an audio amplification system.

**Same Management or Building.&nbsp;** The 2010 Standards add a new exception that allows multiple
  assembly areas that are in the same building and under the same management,
  such as theaters in a multiplex cinema and lecture halls in a college building,
  to calculate the number of receivers required based on the total number of
  seats in all the assembly areas, instead of each assembly area separately,
  where the receivers are compatible with the assistive listening systems used in
  each of the assembly areas.

**Mono Jacks, Sound Pressure, Etc.**&nbsp; Section 4.33.7 of the 1991 Standards does not contain
  specific technical requirements for assistive listening systems. The 2010
  Standards at section 706 require assistive listening systems to have standard
  mono jacks and will require hearing-aid compatible receivers to have neck loops
  to interface with telecoils in hearing aids. The 2010 Standards also specify
  sound pressure level, signal-to-noise ratio, and peak clipping level. Currently
  available assistive listening systems typically meet these technical
  requirements.

#### 220 and 707 Automatic Teller Machines and Fare Machines

Section 707 of the 2010
  Standards adds specific technical requirements for speech output, privacy,
  tactilely-discernible input controls, display screens, and Braille instructions
  to the general accessibility requirements set out in the 1991 Standards.
  Machines shall be speech enabled and exceptions are provided that cover when
  audible tones are permitted, when advertisements or similar information are
  provided, and where speech synthesis cannot be supported. The 1991 Standards
  require these machines to be accessible to and independently usable by persons
  with visual impairments, but do not contain any technical specifications.

#### 221 Assembly Areas

**Wheelchair Spaces/Companion Seats.**&nbsp; Owners of large assembly areas have historically complained
  to the Department that the requirement for one percent (1%) of seating to be
  wheelchair seating is excessive and that wheelchair seats are not being sold. At the same time, advocates have traditionally argued that persons who
  use wheelchairs will increasingly participate in activities at assembly areas
  once they become accessible and that at least one percent (1%) of seats should
  be accessible.

The 1991 Standards, at
  sections 4.1.3(19)(a) and 4.33.3, require assembly areas to provide wheelchair and companion seats. In assembly areas with a capacity of more than five
  hundred seats, accessible seating at a ratio of one percent (1%) (plus one
  seat) of the number of traditional fixed seats must be provided. The 2010
  Standards, at section 221.2, require assembly areas with 501 to 5000 seats to
  provide at least six wheelchair spaces and companion seats plus one additional
  wheelchair space for each additional 150 seats (or fraction thereof) between
  501 through 5000. In assembly areas with more than 5000 seats at least 36
  wheelchair spaces and companion seats plus one additional wheelchair space for
  each 200 seats (or fraction thereof) more than 5000 are required. See sections
  221.1 and 221.2 of the 2010 Standards.

Commenters questioned why
  scoping requirements for large assembly areas are being reduced. During the
  development of the 2004 ADAAG, industry providers, particularly those
  representing larger stadium-style assembly areas, supplied data to the Access
  Board demonstrating the current scoping requirements for large assembly areas
  often exceed the demand. Based on the data provided to the Access Board, the
  Department believes the reduced scoping requirements will adequately meet the
  needs of individuals with disabilities, while balancing concerns of the
  industry.

Commenters representing
  assembly areas supported the reduced scoping. One commenter asked that scoping
  requirements for larger assembly areas be reduced even further. Although the
  commenter referenced data demonstrating that wheelchair spaces in larger
  facilities with seating capacities of 70,000 or more may not be used by
  individuals with disabilities, the data was not based on actual results, but
  was calculated at least in part based on probability assumptions. The
  Department is not convinced that further reductions should be made based upon
  those projections and that further reductions would not substantially limit
  accessibility at assembly areas for persons who use wheelchairs.

Section 221.2.1.3 of the
  2010 Standards clarifies that the scoping requirements for wheelchair spaces
  and companion seats are to be applied separately to general seating areas and
  to each luxury box, club box, and suite in arenas, stadiums, and grandstands.
  In assembly areas other than arenas, stadiums, and grandstands, the scoping
  requirements will not be applied separately. Thus, in performing arts
  facilities with tiered boxes designed for spatial and acoustical purposes, the
  scoping requirement is to be applied to the seats in the tiered boxes. The
  requisite number of wheelchair spaces and companion seats required in the
  tiered boxes are to be dispersed among at least twenty percent (20%) of the
  tiered boxes. For example, if a performing arts facility has 20 tiered boxes
  with 10 fixed seats in each box, for a total of 200 seats, at least five
  wheelchair spaces and companion seats must be provided in the boxes, and they
  must be dispersed among at least four of the 20 boxes.

Commenters raised concerns
  that the 2010 Standards should clarify requirements for scoping of seating
  areas and that requiring accessible seating in each luxury box, club box, and
  suite in arenas, stadiums and grandstands could result in no wheelchair and
  companion spaces available for individuals with disabilities in the general
  seating area(s). These comments appear to misunderstand the requirements. The
  2010 Standards require each luxury box, club box, and suite in an arena,
  stadium or grandstand to be accessible and to contain wheelchair spaces and
  companion seats as required by sections 221.2.1.1, 221.2.1.2 and 221.3. In
  addition, the remaining seating areas not located in boxes must also contain
  the number of wheelchair and companion seating locations specified in the 2010
  Standards based on the total number of seats in the entire facility excluding
  luxury boxes, club boxes and suites.

**Wheelchair Space Overlap in Assembly Areas.**  Section 4.33.3 of the 1991 Standards and the 2010
  Standards, at sections 402, 403.5.1, 802.1.4, and 802.1.5, require walkways
  that are part of an accessible route to have a 36-inch minimum clear width.
  Section 802.1.5 of the 2010 Standards specifically prohibits accessible routes
  from overlapping wheelchair spaces. This change is consistent with the
  technical requirements for accessible routes, since the clear width of
  accessible routes cannot be obstructed by any object. The 2010 Standards also
  specifically prohibit wheelchair spaces from overlapping circulation paths. An
  advisory note clarifies that this prohibition applies only to the circulation
  path width required by applicable building codes and fire and life safety codes
  since the codes prohibit obstructions in the required width of assembly aisles.

Section 802.1.5 of the
  2010 Standards provides that where a main circulation path is located in front
  of a row of seats that contains a wheelchair space and the circulation path is
  wider than required by applicable building codes and fire and life safety
  codes, the wheelchair space may overlap the&quot;extra&quot; circulation path width.
  Where a main circulation path is located behind a row of seats that contains a
  wheelchair space and the wheelchair space is entered from the rear, the aisle
  in front of the row may need to be wider in order not to block the required
  circulation path to the other seats in the row, or a mid-row opening may need
  to be provided to access the required circulation path to the other seats.

**Line of Sight and Dispersion of Wheelchair Spaces in Assembly Areas.**

Section 4.33.3 of the 1991
  Standards requires wheelchair spaces and companion seats to be an integral part
  of any fixed seating plan in assembly areas and to provide individuals with
  disabilities a choice of admission prices and lines of sight comparable to
  those available to other spectators. Section 4.33.3 also requires wheelchair
  spaces and companion seats to be dispersed in assembly areas with more than 300
  seats. Under the 1991 Standards, sports facilities typically located some
  wheelchair spaces and companion seats on each accessible level of the facility.
  In 1994, the Department issued official guidance interpreting the requirement
  for comparable lines of sight in the 1991 Standards to mean wheelchair spaces
  and companion seats in sports stadia and arenas must provide patrons with
  disabilities and their companions with lines of sight over standing spectators
  to the playing field or performance area, where spectators were expected to
  stand during events. See&quot;Accessible Stadiums,&quot; www.ada.gov/stadium.pdf. The
  Department also interpreted the section 4.33.3 comparable lines of sight
  requirement to mean that wheelchair spaces and companion seats in stadium-style
  movie theaters must provide patrons with disabilities and their companions with
  viewing angles comparable to those provided to other spectators.

Sections 221.2.3 and
  802.2 of the 2010 Standards add specific technical requirements for providing
  lines of sight over seated and standing spectators and also require wheelchair
  spaces and companion seats (per section 221.3) to provide individuals with
  disabilities choices of seating locations and viewing angles that are
  substantially equivalent to, or better than, the choices of seating locations
  and viewing angles available to other spectators. This applies to all types of assembly
  areas, including stadium-style movie theaters, sports arenas, and concert
  halls. These rules are expected to have minimal impact since they are
  consistent with the Department&acute;s longstanding interpretation of the 1991
  Standards and technical assistance.

Commenters stated that
  the qualitative viewing angle language contained in section 221.2.3 is not
  appropriate for an enforceable regulatory standard unless the terms of such
  language are defined. Other commenters requested definitions for viewing angles,
  an explanation for precisely how viewing angles are measured, and an
  explanation for precisely how to evaluate whether one viewing angle is better
  than another viewing angle. The Department is convinced that the regulatory
  language in the 2010 Standards is sufficient to provide a performance-based
  standard for designers, architects, and other professionals to design
  facilities that provide comparable lines of sight for wheelchair seating in
  assembly areas, including viewing angles. The Department believes that as a
  general rule, the vast variety of sizes and configurations in assembly areas
  requires it to establish a performance standard for designers to adapt to the
  specific circumstances of the venue that is being designed. The Department has
  implemented more explicit requirements for stadium-style movie theaters in 28
  CFR 36.406(f) and 35.151(g) of the final regulations based on experience and
  expertise gained after several major enforcement actions.

Another commenter
  inquired as to what determines whether a choice of seating locations or viewing
  angles is better than that available to all other spectators. The answer to
  this question varies according to each assembly area that is being designed,
  but designers and venue operators understand which seats are better and that
  understanding routinely drives design choices made to maximize profit and
  successful operation of the facility, among other things. For example, an&quot;equivalent or better&quot; line of sight in a major league football stadium would
  be different than for a 350-seat lecture hall. This performance standard is
  based upon the underlying principle of equal opportunity for a good viewing
  experience for everyone, including persons with disabilities. The Department
  believes that for each specific facility that is designed, the owner, operator,
  and design professionals will be able to distinguish easily between seating
  locations and the quality of the associated lines of sight from those seating
  locations in order to decide which ones are better than others. The wheelchair
  locations do not have to be exclusively among the seats with the very best
  lines of sight nor may they be exclusively among the seats with the worst lines
  of sight. Rather, wheelchair seating locations should offer a choice of viewing
  experiences and be located among the seats where most of the audience chooses
  to sit.

Section 4.33.3 of the
  1991 Standards requires wheelchair spaces and companion seating to be offered
  at a choice of admission prices, but section 221.2.3.2 of the 2010 Standards no
  longer requires wheelchair spaces and companion seats to be dispersed based on
  admission prices. Venue owners and operators commented during the 2004 ADAAG
  rulemaking process that pricing is not always established at the design phase
  and may vary from event to event within the same facility, making it difficult
  to determine where to place wheelchair seats during the design and construction
  phase. Their concern was that a failure by the venue owner or operator to
  provide a choice of ticket prices for wheelchair seating as required by the
  1991 Standards governing new construction could somehow unfairly subject
  parties involved in the design and construction to liability unknowingly.

Sections 221.2.3.2 and
  221.3 of the 2010 Standards require wheelchair spaces and companion seats to be
  vertically dispersed at varying distances from the screen, performance area, or
  playing field. The 2010 Standards, at section 221.2.3.2, also require
  wheelchair spaces and companion seats to be located in each balcony or
  mezzanine served by an accessible route. The final regulations at 28 CFR
  35.151(g)(1) and 36.406(f)(1) also require assembly areas to locate wheelchair
  spaces and companion seats at all levels of the facility that include seating
  and that are served by an accessible route. The Department interprets that
  requirement to mean that wheelchair and companion seating must be provided in a
  particular area even if the accessible route may not be the same route that
  other individuals use to reach their seats. For example, if other patrons reach
  their seats on the field by an inaccessible route (*e.g.*, by stairs), but there is an accessible route that
  complies with section 206.3 that could be connected to seats on the field,
  accessible seats must be placed on the field even if that route is not
  generally available to the public. The 2010 Standards, at section 221.2.3.2,
  provide an exception for vertical dispersion in assembly areas with 300 or
  fewer seats if the wheelchair spaces and companion seats provide viewing angles
  that are equivalent to, or better than, the average viewing angle provided in
  the facility.

Section 221.3 of the 2010
  Standards requires wheelchair spaces and companion seats to be dispersed
  horizontally. In addition, 28 CFR 35.151(g)(2) and 36.406(f)(2) require
  assembly areas that have seating around the field of play or performance area
  to place wheelchair spaces and companion seating all around that field of play
  or performance area.

#### Stadium-Style Movie Theaters

Pursuant to 28 CFR
  35.151(g) and 36.406(f), in addition to other obligations, stadium-style movie
  theaters must meet horizontal and vertical dispersion requirements set forth in
  sections 221.2.3.1 and 221.2.3.2 of the 2010 Standards; placement of wheelchair
  and companion seating must be on a riser or cross-aisle in the stadium section
  of the theater; and placement of such seating must satisfy at least one of the
  following criteria: (i) it is located within the rear sixty percent (60%) of
  the seats provided in the auditorium; or (ii) it is located within the area of
  the auditorium where the vertical viewing angles are between the 40th and 100th
  percentile of vertical viewing angles for all seats in that theater as ranked
  from the first row (1st percentile) to the back row (100th percentile). The
  line-of-sight requirements recognize the importance to the movie-going
  experience of viewing angles, and the final regulations ensure that movie
  patrons with disabilities are provided views of the movie screen comparable to
  other theater patrons. Some commenters supported regulatory language that would
  require stadium-style theaters to meet standards of accessibility equal to
  those of non-stadium-style theaters, with larger theaters being required to
  provide accessible seating locations and viewing angles equal to those offered
  to individuals without disabilities.

One commenter noted that
  stadium-style movie theaters, sports arenas, music venues, theaters, and
  concert halls each pose unique conditions that require separate and specific
  standards to accommodate patrons with disabilities, and recommended that the
  Department provide more specific requirements for sports arenas, music venues,
  theaters, and concert halls. The Department has concluded that the 2010
  Standards will provide sufficient flexibility to adapt to the wide variety of
  assembly venues covered.

**Companion Seats.**  Section
  4.33.3 of the 1991 Standards required at least one fixed companion seat to be
  provided next to each wheelchair space. The 2010 Standards at sections 221.3
  and 802.3 permit companion seats to be movable. Several commenters urged the
  Department to ensure that companion seats are positioned in a manner that
  places the user at the same shoulder height as their companions using mobility
  devices. The Department recognizes that some facilities have created problems
  by locating the wheelchair space and companion seat on different floor
  elevations (often a difference of one riser height). Section 802.3.1 of the
  2010 Standards addresses this problem by requiring the wheelchair space and the
  companion seat to be on the same floor elevation. This solution should prevent
  any vertical discrepancies that are not the direct result of differences in the
  sizes and configurations of wheelchairs.

**Designated Aisle Seats.** Section
  4.1.3(19)(a) of the 1991 Standards requires one percent (1%) of fixed seats in
  assembly areas to be designated aisle seats with either no armrests or folding
  or retractable armrests on the aisle side of the seat. The 2010 Standards, at
  sections 221.4 and 802.4, base the number of required designated aisle seats on
  the total number of aisle seats, instead of on all of the seats in an assembly
  area as the 1991 Standards require. At least five percent (5%) of the aisle
  seats are required to be designated aisle seats and to be located closest to
  accessible routes. This option will almost always result in fewer aisle seats
  being designated aisle seats compared to the 1991 Standards. The Department is
  aware that sports facilities typically locate designated aisle seats on, or as
  near to, accessible routes as permitted by the configuration of the facility.

One commenter recommended
  that section 221.4, Designated Aisle Seats, be changed to require that aisle
  seats be on an accessible route, and be integrated and dispersed throughout an
  assembly area. Aisle seats, by their nature, typically are located within the
  general seating area, and integration occurs almost automatically. The issue of
  dispersing aisle seats or locating them on accessible routes is much more
  challenging. During the separate rulemaking on the 2004 ADAAG the Access Board
  specifically requested public comment on the question of whether aisle seats
  should be required to be located on accessible routes. After reviewing the
  comments submitted during the 2004 Access Board rulemaking, the Access Board
  concluded that this could not be done without making significant and costly
  changes in the design of most assembly areas. However, section 221.4 of the
  2004 ADAAG required that designated aisle seats be the aisle seats closest to
  accessible routes. The Department proposed the same provision and concurs in
  the Access Board&acute;s conclusion and declines to implement further changes.

**Team or Player Seating Areas.** Section 221.2.1.4 of the 2010 Standards requires that at
  least one wheelchair space compliant with section 802.1 be provided in each
  team or player seating area serving areas of sport activity. For bowling lanes,
  the requirement for a wheelchair space in player seating areas is limited to
  lanes required to be accessible.

**Lawn Seating.** The 1991
  Standards, at section 4.1.1(1), require all areas of newly constructed
  facilities to be accessible, but do not contain a specific scoping requirement
  for lawn seating in assembly areas. The 2010 Standards, at section 221.5, specifically
  require lawn seating areas and exterior overflow seating areas without fixed
  seats to connect to an accessible route.

**Aisle Stairs and Ramps in Assembly Areas.** Sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.3(4) of the 1991 Standards require
  that interior and exterior stairs connecting levels that are not connected by
  an elevator, ramp, or other accessible means of vertical access must comply
  with the technical requirements for stairs set out in section 4.9 of the 1991
  Standards. Section 210.1 of the 2010 Standards requires that stairs that are
  part of a means of egress shall comply with section 504&acute;s technical
  requirements for stairs. The 1991 Standards do not contain any exceptions for
  aisle stairs in assembly areas. Section 210.1, Exception 3 of the 2010
  Standards adds a new exception that exempts aisle stairs in assembly areas from
  section 504&acute;s technical requirements for stairs, including section 505&acute;s
  technical requirements for handrails.

Section 4.8.5 of the 1991
  Standards exempts aisle ramps that are part of an accessible route from
  providing handrails on the side adjacent to seating. The 2010 Standards, at
  section 405.1, exempt aisle ramps adjacent to seating in assembly areas and not
  serving elements required to be on an accessible route, from complying with all
  of section 405&acute;s technical requirements for ramps. Where aisle ramps in
  assembly areas serve elements required to be on an accessible route, the 2010
  Standards require that the aisle ramps comply with section 405&acute;s technical
  requirements for ramps. Sections 505.2 and 505.3 of the 2010 Standards provide
  exceptions for aisle ramp handrails. Section 505.2 states that in assembly
  areas, a handrail may be provided at either side or within the aisle width when
  handrails are not provided on both sides of aisle ramps. Section 505.3 states
  that, in assembly areas, handrails need not be continuous in aisles serving
  seating.

#### 222 and 803 Dressing, Fitting, and Locker Rooms

Dressing rooms, fitting
  rooms, and locker rooms are required to comply with the accessibility requirements
  of sections 222 and 803 of the 2010 Standards. Where these types of rooms are
  provided in clusters, five percent (5%) but at least one room in each cluster
  must comply. Some commenters stated that clothing and retail stores would have
  to expand and reconfigure accessible dressing, fitting and locker rooms to meet
  the changed provision for clear floor space alongside the end of the bench.
  Commenters explained that meeting the new requirement would result in a loss of
  sales and inventory space. Other commenters also expressed opposition to the
  changed requirement in locker rooms for similar reasons.

The Department reminds
  the commenters that the requirements in the 2010 Standards for the clear floor
  space to be beside the short axis of the bench in an accessible dressing,
  fitting, or locker room apply only to new construction and alterations. The
  requirements for alterations in the 2010 Standards at section 202.3 do not
  include the requirement from the 1991 Standards at section 4.1.6(1)(c) that if
  alterations to single elements, when considered together, amount to an
  alteration of a room or space in a building or facility, the entire space shall
  be made accessible. Therefore, under the 2010 Standards, the alteration
  requirements only apply to specific elements or spaces that are being altered.
  So providing the clear floor space at the end of the bench as required by the
  2010 Standards instead of in front of the bench as is allowed by the 1991
  Standards would only be required when the bench in the accessible dressing room
  is altered or when the entire dressing room area is altered.

#### 224 and 806 Transient Lodging Guest Rooms

**Scoping.** The minimum
  number of guest rooms required to be accessible in transient lodging facilities
  is covered by section 224 of the 2010 Standards. Scoping requirements for guest
  rooms with mobility features and guest rooms with communication features are
  addressed at section 224.2 and section 224.4, respectively. Under the 1991
  Standards all newly constructed guest rooms with mobility features must provide
  communication features. Under the 2010 Standards, in section 224.5, at least
  one guest room with mobility features must also provide communication features.
  Additionally, not more than ten percent (10%) of the guest rooms required to
  provide mobility features and also equipped with communication features can be
  used to satisfy the minimum number of guest rooms required to provide
  communication features.

Some commenters opposed
  requirements for guest rooms accessible to individuals with mobility
  disabilities stating that statistics provided by the industry demonstrate that
  all types of accessible guest rooms are unused. They further
  claimed that the requirements of the 2010 Standards are too burdensome to meet
  in new construction, and that the requirements will result in a loss of living
  space in places of transient lodging. Other commenters urged the Department to
  increase the number of guest rooms required to be accessible. The number of
  guest rooms accessible to individuals with mobility disabilities and the number
  accessible to persons who are deaf or who are hard of hearing in the 2010
  Standards are consistent with the 1991 Standards and with the IBC. The
  Department continues to receive complaints about the lack of accessible guest
  rooms throughout the country. Accessible guest rooms are used not only by
  individuals using mobility devices such as wheelchairs and scooters, but also
  by individuals with other mobility disabilities including persons who use
  walkers, crutches, or canes.

Data provided by the
  Disability Statistics Center at the University of California, San Francisco
  demonstrated that the number of adults who use wheelchairs has been increasing
  at the rate of six percent (6%) per year from 1969 to 1999; and by 2010, it was
  projected that two percent (2%) of the adult population would use wheelchairs.
  In addition to persons who use wheelchairs, three percent (3%) of adults used crutches, canes, walkers, and other mobility devices in 1999; and the number
  was projected to increase to four percent (4%) by 2010. Thus, in 2010, up to
  six percent (6%) of the population may need accessible guest rooms.

**Dispersion.** The 2010
  Standards, in section 224.5, set scoping requirements for dispersion in
  facilities covered by the transient lodging provisions. This section covers
  guest rooms with mobility features and guest rooms with communication features
  and applies in new construction and alterations. The primary requirement is to
  provide choices of types of guest rooms, number of beds, and other amenities
  comparable to the choices provided to other guests. An advisory in section
  224.5 provides guidance that &quot;factors to be considered in providing an
  equivalent range of options may include, but are not limited to, room size, bed
  size, cost, view, bathroom fixtures such as hot tubs and spas, smoking and
  nonsmoking, and the number of rooms provided.&quot;

Commenters asked the
  Department to clarify what is meant by various terms used in section 224.5 such
  as &quot;classes,&quot; &quot;types,&quot; &quot;options,&quot; and &quot;amenities.&quot; Other commenters asked the
  Department to clarify and simplify the dispersion requirements set forth in
  section 224.5 of the 2010 Standards, in particular the scope of the term
  &quot;amenities.&quot; One commenter expressed concern that views, if considered an
  amenity, would further complicate room categories and force owners and
  operators to make an educated guess. Other commenters stated that views should
  only be a dispersion criteria if view is a factor for pricing room rates.

These terms are not to be
  considered terms of art, but should be used as in their normal course. For
  example, &quot;class&quot; is defined by Webster&acute;s Dictionary as &quot;a division by
  quality.&quot; &quot;Type&quot; is defined as &quot;a
  group of things that share common traits or characteristics distinguishing
  them as an identifiable group or class.&quot; Accordingly, these terms are not
  intended to convey different concepts, but are used as synonyms. In the 2010 Standards, section 224.5 and its advisory require dispersion in such a varied
  range of hotels and lodging facilities that the Department believes that the
  chosen terms are appropriate to convey what is intended. Dispersion required by
  this section is not &quot;one size fits all&quot; and it is imperative that each covered
  entity consider its individual circumstance as it applies this requirement. For
  example, a facility would consider view as an amenity if some rooms faced
  mountains, a beach, a lake, or other scenery that was considered to be a
  premium. A facility where view was not marketed or requested by guests would
  not factor the view as an amenity for purposes of meeting the dispersion
  requirement.

Section 224.5 of the 2010
  Standards requires that guest rooms with mobility features and guest rooms with
  communication features &quot;shall be dispersed among the various classes of guest
  rooms, and shall provide choices of types of guest rooms, number of beds, and
  other amenities comparable to the choices provided to other guests. When the
  minimum number of guest rooms required is not sufficient to allow for complete
  dispersion, guest rooms shall be dispersed in the following priority: guest
  room type, number of beds and amenities.&quot;

This general dispersion
  requirement is intended to effectuate Congress&acute; directive that a percentage of
  each class of hotel rooms is to be fully accessible to persons with
  disabilities. See H.R. Rep. No. 101-485
  (II) at 391. Accordingly, the promise of the ADA in this instance is that
  persons with disabilities will have an equal opportunity to benefit from the
  various options available to hotel guests without disabilities, from single
  occupancy guest rooms with limited features (and accompanying limited price
  tags) to luxury suites with lavish features and choices. The inclusion of
  section 224.5 of the 2010 Standards is not new. Substantially similar language
  is contained in section 9.1.4 of the 1991 Standards.

Commenters raised
  concerns that the factors included in the advisory to section 224.5 of the 2010
  Standards have been expanded. The advisory provides: &quot;[f]actors to be considered
  in providing an equivalent range of options may include, but are not limited
  to, room size, bed size, cost, view, bathroom fixtures such as hot tubs and
  spas, smoking and nonsmoking, and the number of rooms provided.&quot;

As previously discussed,
  the advisory materials provided in the 2010 Standards are meant to be
  illustrative and do not set out specific requirements. In this particular
  instance, the advisory materials for section 224.5 set out some of the common
  types of amenities found at transient lodging facilities, and include common
  sense concepts such as view, bathroom fixtures, and smoking status. The
  intention of these factors is to indicate to the hospitality industry the sorts
  of considerations that the Department, in its enforcement efforts since the
  enactment of the ADA, has considered as amenities that should be made available
  to persons with disabilities, just as they are made available to guests without
  disabilities.

Commenters offered
  several suggestions for addressing dispersion. One option included the
  flexibility to use an equivalent facilitation option similar to that provided
  in section 9.1.4(2) of the 1991 Standards.

The 2010 Standards
  eliminated all specific references to equivalent facilitation. Since Congress
  made it clear that each class of hotel room is to be available to individuals
  with disabilities, the Department declines to adopt such a specific limitation
  in favor of the specific requirement for new construction and alterations found
  in section 224.5 of the 2010 Standards.

In considering the
  comments of the hospitality industry from the ANPRM and the Department&acute;s
  enforcement efforts in this area, the Department sought comment in the NPRM on
  whether the dispersion requirements should be applied proportionally, or
  whether the requirements of section 224.5 of the 2010 Standards would be
  complied with if access to at least one guest room of each type were to be
  provided.

One commenter expressed
  concern about requiring different guest room types to be proportionally
  represented in the accessible guest room pool as opposed to just having each
  type represented. Some commenters also expressed concern about accessible guest
  rooms created in pre-1993 facilities and they requested that such accessible
  guest rooms be safe harbored just as they are safe harbored under the 1991
  Standards. In addition, one commenter requested that the proposed dispersion
  requirements in section 224.5 of the 2010 Standards not be applied to pre-1993
  facilities even when they are altered. Some commenters also offered a
  suggestion for limitations to the dispersion requirements as an alternative to
  safe harboring pre-1993 facilities. The suggestion included: (1) Guest rooms&acute;
  interior or exterior footprints may remain unchanged in order to meet the
  dispersion requirements; (2) Dispersion should only be required among the types
  of rooms affected by an alteration; and (3) Subject to (1) and (2) above and
  technical feasibility, a facility would need to provide only one guest room in
  each guest room type such as single, double and suites. One commenter requested
  an exception to the dispersion criteria that applies to both existing and new
  multi-story timeshare facilities. This requested exception waives dispersion
  based on views to the extent that up to eight units may be vertically stacked
  in a single location.

Section 224.1.1 of the
  2010 Standards sets scoping requirements for alterations to transient lodging
  guest rooms. The advisory to section 224.1.1 further explains that compliance
  with 224.5 is more likely to be achieved if all of the accessible guest rooms
  are not provided in the same area of the facility, when accessible guest rooms
  are added as a result of subsequent alterations.

Some commenters requested
  a specific exemption for small hotels of 300 or fewer guest rooms from
  dispersion regarding smoking rooms. The ADA requires that individuals with
  disabilities be provided with the same range of options as persons without
  disabilities, and, therefore, the Department declines to add such an exemption.
  It is noted, however, that the existence of this language in the advisory does
  not require a place of transient lodging that does not offer smoking guest
  rooms at its facility to do so only for individuals with disabilities.

**Guest Rooms with Mobility Features.** Scoping provisions for guest rooms with mobility features
  are provided in section 224.2 of the 2010 Standards. Scoping requirements for
  alterations are included in 224.1.1. These scoping requirements in the 2010
  Standards are consistent with the 1991 Standards.

One commenter expressed
  opposition to the new scoping provisions for altered guest rooms, which,
  according to the commenter, require greater numbers of accessible guest rooms
  with mobility features.

Section 224.1.1 of the
  2010 Standards provides scoping requirements for alterations to guest rooms in
  existing facilities. Section 224.1.1 modifies the scoping requirements for new
  construction in section 224 by limiting the application of section 224
  requirements only to those guest rooms being altered or added until the number
  of such accessible guest rooms complies with the minimum number required for
  new construction in section 224.2 of the 2010 Standards. The minimum required
  number of accessible guest rooms is based on the total number of guest rooms
  altered or added instead of the total number of guest rooms provided. These
  requirements are consistent with the requirements in the 1991 Standards.
  Language in the 2010 Standards clarifies the provision of section 104.2 of the
  2010 Standards which requires rounding up values to the next whole number for
  calculations of percentages in scoping.

**Guest Rooms with Communication Features.**  The revisions at section 224.4 of the 2010 Standards effect
  no substantive change from the 1991 Standards with respect to the number of
  guest rooms required to provide communication features. The scoping requirement
  is consolidated into a single table, instead of appearing in three sections as
  in the 1991 Standards. The revised provisions also limit the overlap between
  guest rooms required to provide mobility features and guest rooms required to
  provide communication features. Section 224.5 of the 2010 Standards requires
  that at least one guest room providing mobility features must also provide
  communications features. At least one, but not more than ten percent (10%), of
  the guest rooms required to provide mobility features can also satisfy the
  minimum number of guest rooms required to provide communication features.

Commenters suggested that
  the requirements for scoping and dispersion of guest rooms for persons with
  mobility impairments and guest rooms with communication features are too
  complex for the industry to effectively implement.

The Department believes
  the requirements for guest rooms with communications features in the 2010
  Standards clarify the requirements necessary to provide equal opportunity for
  travelers with disabilities. Additional technical assistance will be made
  available to address questions before the rule goes into effect.

**Visible Alarms in Guest Rooms with Communication Features.**  The 1991 Standards at sections
  9.3.1 and 4.28.4 require transient lodging guest rooms with communication
  features to provide either permanently installed visible alarms that are
  connected to the building fire alarm system or portable visible alarms that are
  connected to a standard 110-volt electrical outlet and are both activated by
  the building fire alarm system and provide a visible alarm when the single
  station smoke detector is activated. Section 215.4 of the 2010 Standards no
  longer includes the portable visible alarm option and instead requires that
  transient lodging guest rooms with communication features be equipped with a
  fire alarm system which includes permanently installed audible and visible
  alarms in accordance with NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm Code (1999 or 2002
  edition). Such guest rooms with communication features are also required by
  section 806.3.2 of the 2010 Standards to be equipped with visible notification
  devices that alert room occupants of incoming telephone calls and a door knock
  or bell.

The 2010 Standards add a
  new exception for alterations to existing facilities that exempts existing fire
  alarm systems from providing visible alarms, unless the fire alarm system
  itself is upgraded or replaced, or a new fire alarm system is installed.
  Transient lodging facilities that alter guest rooms are not required to provide
  permanently installed visible alarms complying with the NFPA 72 if the existing
  fire alarm system has not been upgraded or replaced, or a new fire alarm system
  has not been installed.

Commenters representing
  small providers of transient lodging raised concerns about the proposed changes
  to prohibit the use of portable visible alarms used in transient lodging guest
  rooms. These commenters recommended retaining requirements that allow the use
  of portable visible alarms.

Persons who are deaf or
  hard of hearing have reported that portable visible alarms used in transient
  lodging guest rooms are deficient because the alarms are not activated by the
  building fire alarm system, and the alarms do not work when the building power
  source goes out in emergencies. The 2010 Standards are consistent with the
  model building, fire, and life safety codes as applied to newly constructed
  transient lodging facilities. One commenter sought confirmation of its
  understanding of visible alarm requirements from the Department. This commenter
  interpreted the exception to section 215.1 of the 2010 Standards and the
  Department&acute;s commentary to the NPRM to mean that if a transient lodging
  facility does not have permanently installed visible alarms in its
  communication accessible guest rooms, it will not be required to provide such
  alarms until such time that its fire alarm system is upgraded or replaced, or a
  new fire alarm system is installed. In addition, this commenter also understood
  that, if a hotel already has permanently installed visible alarms in all of its
  mobility accessible guest rooms, it would not have to relocate such visible
  alarms and other communication features in those rooms to other guest rooms to
  comply with the ten percent (10%) overlap requirement until the alarm system is
  upgraded or replaced.

This commenter&acute;s
  interpretation and understanding are consistent with the Department&acute;s position
  in this matter. Section 215.4 of the 2010 Standards requires that guest rooms
  required to have communication features be equipped with a fire alarm system
  complying with section 702. Communication accessible guest rooms are required
  to have all of the communication features described in section 806.3 of the
  2010 Standards including a fire alarm system which provides both audible and
  visible alarms. The exception to section 215.1 of the 2010 Standards, which
  applies only to fire alarm requirements for guest rooms with communication
  features in existing facilities, exempts the visible alarm requirement until
  such time as the existing fire alarm system is upgraded or replaced, or a new
  fire alarm system is installed. If guest rooms in existing facilities are altered
  and they are required by section 224 of the 2010 Standards to have
  communication features, such guest rooms are required by section 806.3 to have
  all other communication features including notification devices.

**Vanity Counter Space.** Section
  806.2.4.1 of the 2010 Standards requires that if vanity countertop space is
  provided in inaccessible transient lodging guest bathrooms, comparable vanity
  space must be provided in accessible transient lodging guest bathrooms.

A commenter questioned
  whether in existing facilities vanity countertop space may be provided through
  the addition of a shelf. Another commenter found the term &quot;comparable&quot; vague
  and expressed concern about confusion the new requirement would cause. This
  commenter suggested that the phrase &quot;equal area in square inches&quot; be used
  instead of comparable vanity space.

In some circumstances,
  the addition of a shelf in an existing facility may be a reasonable way to
  provide a space for travelers with disabilities to use their toiletries and
  other personal items. However, this is a determination that must be made on a
  case-by-case basis. Comparable vanity countertop space need not be one
  continuous surface and need not be exactly the same size as the countertops in
  comparable guest bathrooms. For example, accessible shelving within reach of
  the lavatory could be stacked to provide usable surfaces for toiletries and
  other personal items.

**Shower and Sauna Doors in Transient Lodging Facilities.**

Section 9.4 of the 1991 Standards
  and section 206.5.3 of the 2010 Standards both require passage doors in
  transient lodging guest rooms that do not provide mobility features to provide
  at least 32 inches of clear width. Congress directed this requirement to be
  included so that individuals with disabilities could visit guests in other
  rooms. *See* H. Rept. 101-485, pt. 2, at 118 (1990);
  S. Rept. 101-116, at 70 (1989). Section 224.1.2 of the 2010 Standards adds a
  new exception to clarify that shower and sauna doors in such inaccessible guest
  rooms are exempt from the requirement for passage doors to provide at least 32
  inches of clear width. Two commenters requested that saunas and steam rooms in
  existing facilities be exempt from the section 224.1.2 requirement and that the
  requirement be made applicable to new construction only.

The exemption to the
  section 224.1.2 requirement for a 32-inch wide clearance at doors to shower and
  saunas applies only to those showers and saunas in guest rooms which are not
  required to have mobility features. Showers and saunas in other locations,
  including those in common use areas and guest rooms with mobility features, are
  required to comply with the 32-inch clear width standard as well as other
  applicable accessibility standards. Saunas come in a variety of types:
  portable, pre-built, pre-cut, and custom-made. All saunas except for
  custom-made saunas are made to manufacturers&acute; standard dimensions. The
  Department is aware that creating the required 32-inch clearance at existing
  narrower doorways may not always be technically feasible. However, the
  Department believes that owners and operators will have an opportunity to
  provide the required doorway clearance, unless doing so is technically
  infeasible, when an alteration to an existing sauna is undertaken. Therefore,
  the Department has retained these requirements.

**Platform Lifts in Transient Lodging Guest Rooms and Dwelling Units.**  The 1991 Standards, at section
  4.1.3(5), exception 4, and the 2010 Standards, at sections 206.7 and 206.7.6,
  both limit the locations where platform lifts are permitted to be used as part
  of an accessible route. The 2010 Standards add a new scoping requirement that
  permits platform lifts to be used to connect levels within transient lodging
  guest rooms and dwelling units with mobility features.

#### 806 Transient Lodging Guest Rooms

In the NPRM, the
  Department included floor plans showing examples of accessible guest rooms and
  bathrooms designs with mobility features to illustrate how compliance with the
  2010 Standards could be accomplished with little or no additional space
  compared to designs that comply with the 1991 Standards.

Commenters noted that the
  Department&acute;s plans showing accessible transient lodging guest rooms compliant
  with the 2010 Standards were not common in the transient lodging industry and
  also noted that the plans omitted doors at sleeping room closets.

The Department agrees
  that the configuration of the accessible bathrooms is somewhat different from
  past designs used by the industry, but this was done to meet the requirements
  of the 2010 Standards. The plans were provided to show that, with some
  redesign, the 2010 Standards do not normally increase the square footage of an
  accessible sleeping room or bathroom with mobility features in new
  construction. The Department has also modified several accessible guest room
  plans to show that doors can be installed on closets and comply with the 2010
  Standards.

A commenter stated that
  the Department&acute;s drawings suggest that the fan coil units for heat and air
  conditioning are overhead, while the typical sleeping room usually has a
  vertical unit, or a packaged terminal air conditioning unit within the room.
  The Department&acute;s drawings are sample plans, showing the layout of the space,
  relationship of elements to each other, and required clear floor and turning
  spaces. It was not the intent of the Department to provide precise locations
  for all elements, including heating and air conditioning units.

Commenters noted that in
  guest rooms with two beds, each bed was positioned close to a wall, reducing
  access on one side. Another commenter stated that additional housekeeping time
  is needed to clean the room when beds are placed closer to walls. The 2010
  Standards require that, when two beds are provided, there must be at least 36
  inches of clear space between the beds. The plans provided in the NPRM showed
  two bed arrangements with adequate clear width complying with the 1991
  Standards and the 2010 Standards. Additional space can be provided on the other
  side of the beds to facilitate housekeeping as long as the clear floor space
  between beds is at least 36 inches wide.

Commenters stated that
  chases in sleeping room bathrooms that route plumbing and other utilities can
  present challenges when modifying existing facilities. In multi-story
  facilities, relocating or re-routing these elements may not be possible,
  limiting options for providing access. The Department recognizes that
  relocating mechanical chases in multi-story facilities may be difficult or
  impossible to accomplish. While these issues do not exist in new facilities,
  altered existing facilities must comply with the 2010 Standards to the extent
  that it is technically feasible to do so. When an alteration cannot fully
  comply because it is technically infeasible to do so, the alteration must still
  be designed to comply to the greatest extent feasible.

Commenters noted that on
  some of the Department&acute;s plans where a vanity is located adjacent to a bathtub,
  the vanity may require more maintenance due to exposure to water. The
  Department agrees that it would be advisable that items placed next to a
  bathtub or shower be made of materials that are not susceptible to water
  damage.

#### 225 and 811 Storage

Section 225 of the 2010
  Standards provides that where storage is provided in accessible spaces, at
  least one of each type shall comply with the 2010 Standards. Self-service shelving is required to be
  on an accessible route, but is not required to comply with the reach range
  requirements. These requirements are consistent with the 1991 Standards.

Section 225.3 adds a new
  scoping requirement for self-storage facilities. Facilities with 200 or fewer
  storage spaces will be required to make at least five percent (5%) of the
  storage spaces accessible. Facilities with more than 200 storage spaces will be
  required to provide ten accessible storage spaces, plus two percent (2%) of the
  total storage spaces over 200.

Sections 225.2.1 and 811
  of the 2010 Standards require lockers to meet accessibility requirements. Where
  lockers are provided in clusters, five percent (5%) but at least one locker in
  each cluster will have to comply. Under the 1991 Standards, only one locker of
  each type provided must be accessible.

Commenters recommended
  that the Department adopt language requiring public accommodations to provide
  access to all self-service shelves and display areas available to customers.
  Other commenters opposed this requirement as too burdensome to retail and other
  entities and claimed that significant revenue would be lost if this requirement
  were to be implemented.

Other commenters raised
  concerns that section 225.2.2 of the 2010 Standards scopes only self-service
  shelving whereas section 4.1.3(12)(b) of the 1991 Standards applies to both
  &quot;shelves or display units.&quot;

Although &quot;display units&quot;
  were not included in the 2010 Standards under the belief that displays are not
  to be touched and therefore by definition cannot be &quot;self-service,&quot; both the
  2010 Standards and the 1991 Standards should be read broadly to apply to all
  types of shelves, racks, hooks, and similar self-service merchandising
  fittings, including self-service display units. Such fixtures are permitted to
  be installed above or below the reach ranges possible for many persons with
  disabilities so that space available for merchandising is used as efficiently
  as possible.

#### 226 and 902 Dining Surfaces and Work Surfaces

Section 226.1 of the 2010
  Standards require that where dining surfaces are provided for the consumption
  of food or drink, at least five percent (5%) of the seating spaces and standing
  spaces at the dining surfaces comply with section 902. Section 902.2 requires
  the provision of accessible knee and toe clearance.

Commenters stated that
  basing accessible seating on seating spaces and standing spaces potentially
  represents a significant increase in scoping, particularly given the ambiguity
  in what represents a &quot;standing space&quot; and urged a return to the 1991 Standard
  of requiring accessible seating based on fixed dining tables. The scoping
  change merely takes into account that tables may vary in size so that basing
  the calculation on the number of tables rather than on the number of
  individuals that may be accommodated by the tables could unnecessarily restrict
  opportunities for persons with disabilities. The revised scoping permits
  greater flexibility by allowing designers to disperse accessible seating and
  standing spaces throughout the dining area. Human factors data, which is
  readily available to designers, provides information about the amount of space
  required for both eating and drinking while seated or standing.

#### 227 and 904 Sales and Service

**Check-Out Aisles and Sales and Service Counters.**  The 1991 Standards, at section 7.2, and the 2010 Standards,
  at section 904.4, contain technical requirements for sales and service counters.
  The 1991 Standards generally require sales and service counters to provide an
  accessible portion at least 36 inches long and no higher than 36 inches above
  the finish floor. The nondiscrimination requirements of the ADA regulations
  require the level of service provided at the accessible portion of any sales
  and service counter to be the same as the level of service provided at the
  inaccessible portions of the counter.

The 2010 Standards
  specify different lengths for the accessible portion of sales and service
  counters based on the type of approach provided. Where a forward approach is
  provided, the accessible portion of the counter must be at least 30 inches long
  and no higher than 36 inches, and knee and toe space must be provided under the
  counter. The requirement that knee and toe space be provided where only clear
  floor space for a forward approach to a sales and service counter is provided
  is not a new requirement. It is a clarification of the ongoing requirement that
  part of the sales and service counter be accessible. This requirement applies
  to the entire accessible part of sales and service counters and requires that
  the accessible clear floor or ground space adjacent to those counters be kept
  clear of merchandise, equipment, and other items so that the accessible part of
  the counter is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with
  disabilities. The accessible part of the counter must also be staffed and
  provide an equivalent level of service as that provided to all customers.

Where clear floor space
  for a parallel approach is provided, the accessible portion of the counter must
  be at least 36 inches long and no higher than 36 inches above the finish floor.
  A clear floor or ground space that is at least 48 inches long x 30 inches wide must
  be provided positioned for a parallel approach adjacent to the 36-inch minimum
  length of counter.

Section 904.4 of the 2010
  Standards includes an exception for alterations to sales and service counters
  in existing facilities. It permits the accessible portion of the counter to be
  at least 24 inches long, where providing a longer accessible counter will
  result in a reduction in the number of existing counters at work stations or
  existing mailboxes, provided that the required clear floor or ground space is
  centered on the accessible length of the counter.

Section 904.4 of the 2010
  Standards also clarifies that the accessible portion of the counter must extend
  the same depth as the sales or service counter top. Where the counter is a
  single-height counter, this requirement applies across the entire depth of the
  counter top. Where the counter is a split-height counter, this requirement
  applies only to the customer side of the counter top. The employee-side of the
  counter top may be higher or lower than the customer-side of the counter top.

Commenters recommended that the Department consider a regulatory alternative exempting small retailers
  from the new knee and toe clearance requirement and retaining existing
  wheelchair accessibility standards for sales and service counters. These
  commenters believed that the knee and toe clearance requirements will cause a
  reduction in the sales and inventory space at check-out aisles and other sales
  and service counters.

Both the 1991 and the
  2010 Standards permit covered entities to determine whether they will provide a
  forward or a parallel approach to sales and service counters. So any facility
  that does not wish to provide the knee or toe clearance required for a front
  approach to such a counter may avoid that option. However, the Department
  believes that permitting a forward approach without requiring knee and toe
  clearance is not adequate to provide accessibility because the person using a
  wheelchair will be prevented from coming close enough to the counter to see the
  merchandise or to transact business with a degree of convenience that is
  comparable to that provided to other customers.

A parallel approach to
  sales and service counters also can provide the accessibility required by the
  2010 Standards. Individuals using wheelchairs can approach sales and service
  counters from the side, and, assuming the necessary elements, features, or
  merchandise necessary to complete a business transaction are within the reach
  range requirements for a side approach, the needs of individuals with
  disabilities can be met effectively.

Section 227 of the 2010
  Standards clarifies the requirements for food service lines. Queues and waiting
  lines serving counters or check-out aisles, including those for food service,
  must be accessible to individuals with disabilities.

#### 229 Windows

A new requirement at
  section 229.1 of the 2010 Standards provides that if operable windows are
  provided for building users, then at least one window in an accessible space
  must be equipped with controls that comply with section 309.

Commenters generally
  supported this provision but some commenters asked whether the maximum
  five-pounds (5 lbs.) of force requirement of section 309 applies to the window
  latch itself or only to the force required to open the window. Section 309 applies to all controls and
  operating mechanisms, so the latch must comply with the requirement to operate
  with no more than five pounds of force (5 lbf).

#### 230 and 708 Two-Way Communication Systems

New provisions of the
  2010 Standards at sections 230.1 and 708 require two-way communications systems
  to be equipped with visible as well as audible signals.

#### 231 and 808 Judicial Facilities and Courtrooms

Section 231 of the 2010
  Standards adds requirements for accessible courtrooms, holding cells, and
  visiting areas.

**Accessible Courtroom Stations.** Sections 231.2, 808, 304, 305, and 902 of the 2010
  Standards provide increased accessibility at courtroom stations. Clear floor
  space for a forward approach is required for all courtroom stations (judges&acute;
  benches, clerks&acute; stations, bailiffs&acute; stations, deputy clerks&acute; stations, court
  reporters&acute; stations, and litigants&acute; and counsel stations). Other applicable
  specifications include accessible work surface heights and toe and knee
  clearance.

**Accessible Jury Boxes, Attorney Areas, and Witness Stands.**  Section 206.2.4 of the 2010
  Standards requires, in new construction and alterations, at least one
  accessible route to connect accessible building or facility entrances with all
  accessible spaces and elements within the building or facility that are
  connected by a circulation path unless they are exempted by Exceptions 1 - 7 of
  section 206.2.3. Advisory 206.2.4 Spaces and Elements Exception 1 explains that
  the exception allowing raised courtroom stations to be used by court employees,
  such as judge&acute;s benches, to be adaptable does not apply to areas of the
  courtroom likely to be used by members of the public such as jury areas,
  attorney areas, or witness stands. These areas must be on an accessible route
  at the time of initial construction or alteration.

**Raised Courtroom Stations Not for Members of the Public.**  Section 206.2.4, Exception 1 of
  the 2010 Standards provides that raised courtroom stations that are used by
  judges, clerks, bailiffs, and court reporters will not have to provide full
  vertical access when first constructed or altered if they are constructed to be
  easily adaptable to provide vertical accessibility.

One commenter suggested
  that a sufficient number of accessible benches for judges with disabilities, in
  addition to requiring accessible witness stands and attorney areas, be
  required. The Department believes
  that the requirements regarding raised benches for judges are easily adaptable to
  provide vertical access in the event a judge requires an accessible bench.
  Section 206.2.4 of the 2010 Standards provides that raised courtroom stations
  used by judges and other judicial staff do not have to provide full vertical
  access when first constructed or altered as long as the required clear floor
  space, maneuvering space, and electrical service, where appropriate, is
  provided at the time of new construction or can be achieved without substantial
  reconstruction during alterations.

A commenter asserted that
  there is nothing inherent in clerks&acute; stations, jury boxes, and witness stands
  that require them to be raised. While it would, of course, be easiest to
  provide access by eliminating height differences among courtroom elements, the
  Department recognizes that accessibility is only one factor that must be
  considered in the design process of a functioning courtroom. The need to ensure
  the ability of the judge to maintain order, the need to ensure sight lines
  among the judge, the witness, the jury, and other participants, and the need to
  maintain the security of the participants all affect the design of the space.
  The Department believes that the 2010 Standards have been drafted in a way that
  will achieve accessibility without unduly constraining the ability of a
  designer to address the other considerations that are unique to courtrooms.

Commenters argued that
  permitting courtroom stations to be adaptable rather than fully accessible at
  the time of new construction likely will lead to discrimination in hiring of
  clerks, court reporters, and other court staff. The Department believes that
  the provisions will facilitate, not hinder, the hiring of court personnel who
  have disabilities. All courtroom work stations will be on accessible routes and
  will be required to have all fixed elements designed in compliance with the
  2010 Standards. Elevated work stations for court employees may be designed to
  add vertical access as needed. Since the original design must provide the
  proper space and electrical wiring to install vertical access, the change
  should be easily accomplished.

#### 232 Detention Facilities and Correctional Facilities

Section 232 of the 2010
  Standards establishes requirements for the design and construction of cells,
  medical care facilities, and visiting areas in detention facilities and in correctional
  facilities. Section 35.151(k) of the Department&acute;s title II rule provides
  scoping for newly constructed general holding cells and general housing cells
  requiring mobility features compliant with section 807.2 of the 2010 Standards
  in a minimum of three percent (3%) of cells, but no fewer than one cell.
  Section 232.2 of the 2010 Standards provides scoping for newly constructed
  cells with communications features requiring a minimum of two percent (2%) of
  cells, but at least one cell, to have communication features.

The Department&acute;s title II
  rule at &sect; 35.151(k) also specifies scoping for alterations to detention and
  correctional facilities. Generally a minimum of three percent (3%), but no
  fewer than one, of the total number of altered cells must comply with section
  807.2 of the 2010 Standards and be provided within each facility. Altered cells with mobility features must be provided in each classification level, including administrative and
  disciplinary segregation, each use and service area, and special program. The
  Department notes that the three percent (3%), but no fewer than one,
  requirement is a minimum. As corrections systems plan for new facilities or
  alterations, the Department urges planners to include in their population
  estimates a projection of the numbers of inmates with disabilities so as to
  have sufficient numbers of accessible cells to meet inmate needs.

#### 233 Residential Facilities

**Homeless Shelters, Group Homes, and Similar Social Service Establishments.** Section 233 of the 2010 Standards
  includes specific scoping and technical provisions that apply to new
  construction and alteration of residential facilities. In the 1991 Standards
  scoping and technical requirements for homeless shelters, group homes, and
  similar social service establishments were included in section 9 Transient
  Lodging. These types of facilities will be covered by section 233 of the 2010
  Standards and by 28 CFR 35.151(e) and 36.406(d) and will be subject to
  requirements for residential facilities rather than the requirements for
  transient lodging. This approach will harmonize federal accessibility
  obligations under both the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
  1973, as amended. In sleeping rooms with more than 25 beds that are covered by &sect; 36.406(d) a minimum of five
  percent (5%) of the beds must have clear floor space compliant with section
  806.2.3 of the 2010 Standards. In large facilities with more than 50 beds, at
  least one roll-in shower compliant with section 608.2.2 or section 608.2.3 of
  the 2010 Standards must be provided. Where separate shower facilities are
  provided for men and for women, at least one roll-in shower must be provided
  for each gender.

**Housing Operated By or On Behalf of Places of Education.** Housing at a place of education
  includes: residence halls, dormitories, suites, apartments, or other places of
  residence operated by or on behalf of places of education. Residence halls or
  dormitories operated by or on behalf of places of education are covered by the
  provisions in sections 224 and 806 of the 2010 Standards. The Department has
  included in the title III rule at &sect; 36.406(e) requirements that apply to
  housing at places of education that clarify requirements for residence halls
  and dormitories and other types of student housing. Requirements for housing at
  a place of education covered by the title II rule are included at &sect;
  35.151(f).

**Kitchens and Kitchenettes.** Section
  4.34.2 of the UFAS requires a clear turning space at least 60 inches in
  diameter or an equivalent T-shaped turning space in kitchens. Section 4.34.6
  requires a clearance between opposing base cabinets, counters, appliances, or
  walls of at least 40 inches except in a U-shaped kitchen where the minimum
  clearance is 60 inches.

Section 804 of the 2010
  Standards provides technical requirements for kitchens and kitchenettes.
  Section 804.2.1 requires that pass through kitchens, which have two entries and
  counters, appliances, or cabinets on two opposite sides or opposite a parallel
  wall, provide at least 40 inches minimum clearance. Section 804.2.2 requires
  that U-shaped kitchens, which are enclosed on three continuous sides, provide
  at least 60 inches minimum clearance between all opposing base cabinets,
  countertops, appliances, or walls within kitchen work areas. Kitchens that do
  not have a cooktop or conventional range are exempt from the clearance
  requirements but still must provide an accessible route.

If a kitchen does not
  have two entries, the 2010 Standards require the kitchen to have 60 inches
  minimum clearance between the opposing base cabinets, counters, appliances, or
  walls.

One commenter supported
  the provisions of section 804 of the 2010 Standards but sought clarification
  whether this section applies to residential units only, or to lodging and
  office buildings as well. Section 212 makes section 804 applicable to all
  kitchens and kitchenettes in covered buildings.

**Residential Facilities.** Section
  4.1.4(11) of the UFAS contains scoping requirements for the new construction of
  housing. Under the 1991 title II regulation, state and local governments had
  the option of complying with the UFAS or the 1991 Standards. After the
  compliance date for the 2010 Standards, state and local governments will no
  longer have the option of complying with the UFAS, but will have to use the
  2010 Standards for new construction and alterations.

Sections 233.1, 233.2,
  233.3, 233.3.1, and 233.3.2 of the 2010 Standards differentiate between
  entities subject to the United States Department of Housing and Urban
  Development (HUD) regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation
  Act of 1973 and entities not subject to the HUD regulations. The HUD
  regulations apply to recipients of federal financial assistance through HUD,
  and require at least five percent (5%) of dwelling units in multi-family
  projects of five or more dwelling units to provide mobility features and at
  least two percent (2%) of the dwelling units to provide communication features.
  The HUD regulations define a project unique to its programs as &quot;one or more residential
  structures which are covered by a single contract for federal financial
  assistance or application for assistance, or are treated as a whole for
  processing purposes, whether or not located on a common site.&quot; To avoid any
  potential conflicts with the HUD regulations, the 2010 Standards require
  residential dwelling units subject to the HUD regulations to comply with the
  scoping requirements in the HUD regulations, instead of the scoping
  requirements in the 2010 Standards.

For entities not subject
  to the HUD regulations, the 2010 Standards require at least five percent (5%)
  of the dwelling units in residential facilities to provide mobility features,
  and at least two percent (2%) of the dwelling units to provide communication
  features. The 2010 Standards define facilities in terms of buildings located on
  a site. The 2010 Standards permit facilities that contain 15 or fewer dwelling
  units to apply the scoping requirements to all the dwelling units that are
  constructed under a single contract, or are developed as whole, whether or not
  located on a common site.

**Alterations to Residential Facilities.** Section 4.1.6 of the UFAS requires federal, state, and
  local government housing to comply with the general requirements for
  alterations to facilities. Applying the general requirements for alterations to
  housing can result in partially accessible dwelling units where single elements
  or spaces in dwelling units are altered.

The 2010 Standards, at
  sections 202.3 Exception 3, 202.4, and 233.3, contain specific scoping
  requirements for alterations to dwelling units. Dwelling units that are not
  required to be accessible are exempt from the general requirements for
  alterations to elements and spaces and for alterations to primary function
  areas.

The scoping requirements
  for alterations to dwelling units generally are based on the requirements in
  the UFAS:

- Where a building is vacated for purposes
of alterations and has more than 15 dwelling units, at least five percent (5%)
of the altered dwelling units are required to provide mobility features and at
least two percent (2%) of the dwelling units are required to provide
communication features.
- Where a bathroom or a kitchen is
substantially altered in an individual dwelling unit and at least one other
room is also altered, the dwelling unit is required to comply with the scoping
requirements for new construction until the total number of dwelling units in
the facility required to provide mobility features and communication features
is met.

As with new construction,
  the 2010 Standards permit facilities that contain 15 or fewer dwelling units to
  apply the scoping requirements to all the dwelling units that are altered under
  a single contract, or are developed as a whole, whether or not located on a
  common site. The 2010 Standards also permit a comparable dwelling unit to
  provide mobility features where it is not technically feasible for the altered
  dwelling unit to comply with the technical requirements.

#### 234 and 1002 Amusement Rides

**New and Altered Permanently Installed Amusement Rides**. Section 234 of the 2010 Standards
  sets out scoping requirements and section 1002 sets out the technical
  requirements for the accessibility of permanently installed amusement rides.
  These requirements apply to newly designed and constructed amusement rides and
  used rides when certain alterations are made.

A commenter raised
  concerns that smaller amusement parks tend to purchase used rides more
  frequently than new rides, and that the conversion of a used ride to provide
  the required accessibility may be difficult to ensure because of the possible
  complications in modifying equipment to provide accessibility.

The Department agrees
  with this commenter. The Department notes, however, that the 2010 Standards
  will require modifications to existing amusement rides when a ride&acute;s structural
  and operational characteristics are altered to the extent that the ride&acute;s
  performance differs from that specified by the manufacturer or the original
  design. Such an extensive alteration to an amusement ride may well require that
  new load and unload areas be designed and constructed. When load and unload
  areas serving existing amusement rides are newly designed and constructed they
  must be level, provide wheelchair turning space, and be on an accessible route
  compliant with Chapter 4 of the 2010 Standards except as modified by section
  1002.2 of the 2010 Standards.

**Mobile or Portable Amusement Rides.**  The exception in section 234.1 of the 2010 Standards
  exempts mobile or portable amusement rides, such as those set up for short
  periods of time at carnivals, fairs or festivals, from having to comply with
  the 2010 Standards. However, even though the mobile/portable ride itself is not
  subject to the Standards, these facilities are still subject to the ADA&acute;s general
  requirement to ensure that individuals with disabilities have an equal
  opportunity to enjoy the services and amenities of these facilities.

Subject to these general
  requirements, mobile or portable amusement rides should be located on an
  accessible route and the load and unload areas serving a ride should provide a
  level wheelchair turning space to provide equal opportunity for individuals
  with disabilities to be able to participate on the amusement ride to the extent
  feasible.

One commenter noted that
  the exception in Section 234.1 of the 2010 Standards for mobile or portable
  amusement rides limits the opportunities of persons with disabilities to
  participate on amusement rides because traveling or temporary amusement rides
  by their nature come to their customers&acute; town or a nearby town rather than the
  customer having to go to them and so are less expensive than permanent
  amusement parks. While the Department understands the commenter&acute;s concerns, the
  Department notes that most amusement rides are too complex to be reasonably
  modified or re-engineered to accommodate the majority of individuals with
  disabilities and that additional complexities and safety concerns are added
  when the rides are mobile or portable.

A commenter asked that
  section 234 of the 2010 Standards make clear that the requirements for
  accessible routes include the routes leading up to and including the loading
  and unloading areas of amusement rides. Sections 206.2.9 and 1002.2 of the 2010
  Standards clarify that the requirements for accessible routes include the
  routes leading up to and including the loading and unloading areas of amusement
  rides.

A commenter requested
  that the final rule specifically allow for wheelchair access through the exit
  or other routes, or alternate means of wheelchair access routes to amusement
  rides. The commenter stated that the concept of wheelchair access through the
  exit or alternate routes was a base assumption for the 2010 Standards. The
  commenter noted that the concept is apparent in the signage and load/unload
  area provisions in Section 216.12 (&quot;where accessible unload areas also
  serve as accessible load areas, signs indicating the location of the accessible
  load and unload areas shall be provided at entries to queues and waiting
  lines&quot;). The Department agrees with the commenter that accessible load and
  unload areas may be the same where signs that comply with section 216.12 are
  provided.

**Wheelchair Space or Transfer Seat or Transfer Device.**  Sections 234.3 and 1002.4 - 1002.6
  of the 2010 Standards provide that each new and altered amusement ride, except
  for mobile/portable rides and a few additional excepted rides, will be required
  to provide at least one type of access by means of one wheelchair space or one
  transfer seat or one transfer device (the design of the transfer device is not
  specified).

Commenters urged the
  Department to revise the requirements for wheelchair spaces and transfer seats
  and devices because most amusement rides are too complex to be reasonably
  modified or re-engineered to accommodate the majority of individuals with
  disabilities. They argued that the experience of amusement rides will be
  significantly reduced if the proposed requirements are implemented.

The 2004 ADAAG, which the
  Department adopted as part of the 2010 Standards, was developed with the
  assistance of an advisory committee that included representation from the
  design staffs of major amusement venues and from persons with disabilities. The
  Department believes that the resulting 2004 ADAAG reflected sensitivity to the
  complex problems posed in adapting existing rides by focusing on new rides that
  can be designed from the outset to be accessible.

To permit maximum design
  flexibility, the 2010 Standards permit designers to determine whether it is
  more appropriate to permit individuals who use wheelchairs to remain in their
  chairs on the ride, or to provide for transfer access.

**Maneuvering Space in Load and Unload Areas.** Sections 234.2 and 1002.3 of the 2010 Standards require that a level wheelchair turning space be provided at the load and unload areas
  of each amusement ride. The turning space must comply with sections 304.2 and
  304.3.

**Signs Required at Waiting Lines to Amusement Rides.**  Section 216.12 of the 2010
  Standards requires signs at entries to queues and waiting lines identifying
  type and location of access for the amusement ride.

#### 235 and 1003 Recreational Boating Facilities

These sections require
  that accessible boat slips and boarding piers be provided. Most commenters
  approved of the requirements for recreational boating facility accessibility
  and urged the Department to keep regulatory language consistent with those
  provisions. They commented that the requirements appropriately reflect industry
  conditions. Individual commenters and disability organizations agreed that the
  2010 Standards achieve acceptable goals for recreational boating facility
  access.

**Accessible Route.** Sections 206.2.10 and 1003.2 of the 2010 Standards require an
  accessible route to all accessible boating facilities, including boat slips and
  boarding piers at boat launch ramps. Section 1003.2.1 provides a list of
  exceptions applicable to structures such as gangways, transition plates,
  floating piers, and structures containing combinations of these elements that
  are affected by water level changes. The list of exceptions specifies alternate
  design requirements applicable to these structures which, because of water
  level variables, cannot comply with the slope, cross slope, and handrail
  requirements for fixed ramps contained in sections 403.3, 405.2, 405.3, 405.6,
  and 405.7 of the 2010 Standards. Exceptions 3 and 4 in Section 1003.2.1, which
  permit a slope greater than that specified in Section 405.2, are available for
  structures that meet specified length requirements. Section 206.7.10 permits
  the use of platform lifts as an alternative to gangways that are part of
  accessible routes.

Commenters raised
  concerns that because of water level fluctuations it may be difficult to
  provide accessible routes to all accessible boating facilities, including boat
  slips and boarding piers at boat launch ramps. One of the specific concerns
  expressed by several commenters relates to the limits for running slope
  permitted on gangways that are part of an accessible route as gangways may periodically
  have a steeper slope than is permitted for a fixed ramp. The exceptions
  contained in section 1003.2 of the 2010 Standards modify the requirements of
  Chapter 4. For example, where the total length of a gangway or series of
  gangways serving as an accessible route is 80 feet or more an exception permits
  the slope on gangways to exceed the maximum slope in section 405.2.

Some commenters suggested
  that permissible slope variations could be reduced further by introducing a
  formula that ties required gangway length to anticipated water level
  fluctuations. Such a formula would incorporate predictions of tidal level
  changes such as those issued by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
  Administration (NOAA) and the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). This
  suggested approach would be an alternative to the gangway length exceptions and
  limits in section 1003.2.1 of the 2010 Standards. These commenters noted that
  contemporary building materials and techniques make gangways of longer length
  and alternative configurations achievable. These commenters provided at least
  one example of a regional regulatory authority using this type of formula.
  While this approach may be successfully implemented and consistent with the
  goals of the ADA, the example provided was applied in a highly developed area
  containing larger facilities. The Department has considered that many
  facilities do not have sufficient resources available to take advantage of the
  latest construction materials and design innovations. Other commenters
  supported compliance exceptions for facilities that are subject to extreme
  tidal conditions. One commenter noted that if a facility is located in an area
  with limited space and extreme tidal variations, a disproportionately long
  gangway might intrude into water travel routes. The Department has considered a
  wide range of boating facility characteristics including size, water surface
  areas, tidal fluctuations, water conditions, variable resources, whether the
  facility is in a highly developed or remote location, and other factors. The
  Department has determined that the 2010 Standards provide sufficient
  flexibility for such broad application. Additionally, the length requirement
  for accessible routes in section 1003.2.1 provides an easily determinable compliance
  standard.

**Accessible Boarding Piers.**  Where
  boarding piers are provided at boat launch ramps, sections 235.3 and 1003.3.2
  of the 2010 Standards require that at least five percent (5%) of boarding
  piers, but at least one, must be accessible.

**Accessible Boat Slips.** Sections
  235.2 and 1003.3.1 of the 2010 Standards require that a specified number of
  boat slips in each recreational boating facility meet specified accessibility
  standards. The number of accessible boat slips required by the 2010 Standards is
  set out in a chart in section 235.2. One accessible boat slip is required for
  facilities containing 25 or fewer total slips. The number of required
  accessible boat slips increases with the total number of slips at the facility.
  Facilities containing more than one thousand (1000) boat slips are required to
  provide twelve (12) accessible boat slips plus one for each additional one
  hundred slips at the facility.

One commenter asserted
  the need for specificity in the requirement for dispersion of accessible slips.
  Section 235.2.1 of the 2010 Standards addresses dispersion and requires that
  boat slips &quot;shall be dispersed throughout the various types of boat slips
  provided.&quot; The commenter was concerned that if a marina could not put
  accessible slips all on one pier, it would have to reconstruct the entire
  facility to accommodate accessible piers, gangways, docks and walkways. The
  provision permits required accessible boat slips to be grouped together. The
  Department recognizes that economical and structural feasibility may produce
  this result. The 2010 Standards do not require the dispersion of the physical
  location of accessible boat slips. Rather, the dispersion must be among the
  various types of boat slips offered by the facility. Section 235.2.1 of the 2010
  Standards specifies that if the required number has been met, no further
  dispersion is required. For example, if a facility offers five different &acute;types&acute; of boat slips but is only required to provide three according to the
  table in Section 235.2, that facility is not required to provide more than
  three accessible boat slips, but the three must be varied among the five &acute;types&acute; of boat slips available at the facility.

#### 236 and 1004 Exercise Machines and Equipment

**Accessible Route to Exercise Machines and Equipment.**  Section 206.2.13 of the 2010 Standards requires an accessible route to serve accessible exercise machines and equipment.

Commenters raised
  concerns that the requirement to provide accessible routes to serve accessible
  exercise machines and equipment will be difficult for some facilities to
  provide, especially some transient lodging facilities that typically locate
  exercise machines and equipment in a single room. The Department believes that
  this requirement is a reasonable one in new construction and alterations
  because accessible exercise machines and equipment can be located so that an
  accessible route can serve more than one piece of equipment.

**Exercise Machines and Equipment.** Section 236 of the 2010 Standards requires at least one of
  each type of exercise machine to meet clear floor space requirements of section
  1004.1. Types of machines are generally defined according to the muscular
  groups exercised or the kind of cardiovascular exercise provided.

Several commenters were
  concerned that existing facilities would have to reduce the number of available
  exercise equipment and machines in order to comply with the 2010 Standards. One
  commenter submitted prototype drawings showing equipment and machine layouts
  with and without the required clearance specified in the 2010 Standards. The
  accessible alternatives all resulted in a loss of equipment and machines.
  However, because these prototype layouts included certain possibly erroneous
  assumptions about the 2010 Standards, the Department wishes to clarify the
  requirements.

Section 1004.1 of the
  2010 Standards requires a clear floor space &quot;positioned for transfer or for use
  by an individual seated in a wheelchair&quot; to serve at least one of each type of
  exercise machine and equipment. This requirement provides the designer greater
  flexibility regarding the location of the clear floor space than was employed
  by the commenter who submitted prototype layouts. The 2010 Standards do not
  require changes to exercise machines or equipment in order to make them more
  accessible to persons with disabilities. Even where machines or equipment do
  not have seats and typically are used by individuals in a standing position, at
  least one of each type of machine or equipment must have a clear floor space.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that persons with disabilities wishing to
  use this type of machine or equipment can stand or walk, even if they use
  wheelchairs much of the time. As indicated in Advisory 1004.1, &quot;the position of
  the clear floor space may vary greatly depending on the use of the equipment or
  machine.&quot; Where exercise equipment or machines require users to stand on them,
  the clear floor space need not be located parallel to the length of the machine
  or equipment in order to provide a lateral seat-to-platform transfer. It is
  permissible to locate the clear floor space for such machines or equipment in
  the aisle behind the device and to overlap the clear floor space and the
  accessible route.

Commenters were divided
  in response to the requirement for accessible exercise machines and equipment.
  Some supported requirements for accessible machines and equipment; others urged
  the Department not to require accessible machines and equipment because of the
  costs involved. The Department believes that the requirement strikes an
  appropriate balance in ensuring that persons with disabilities, particularly
  those who use wheelchairs, will have the opportunity to use the exercise
  equipment. Providing access to exercise machines and equipment recognizes the
  need and desires of individuals with disabilities to have the same opportunity
  as other patrons to enjoy the advantages of exercise and maintaining health.

#### 237 and 1005 Fishing Piers and Platforms

**Accessible Route.**  Sections 206.2.14 and 1005.1 of the 2010 Standards require an accessible route to each
  accessible fishing pier and platform. The exceptions described under
  Recreational Boating above also apply to gangways and floating piers. All
  commenters supported the requirements for accessible routes to fishing piers
  and platforms.

**Accessible Fishing Piers and Platforms.** Sections 237 and 1005 of the 2010
  Standards require at least twenty-five percent (25%) of railings, guards, or
  handrails (if provided) to be at a 34-inch maximum height (so that a person
  seated in a wheelchair can cast a fishing line over the railing) and to be
  located in a variety of locations on the fishing pier or platform to give
  people a variety of locations to fish. An exception allows a guard required to
  comply with the IBC to have a height greater than 34 inches. If railings,
  guards, or handrails are provided, accessible edge protection and clear floor
  or ground space at accessible railings are required. Additionally, at least one
  turning space complying with section 304.3 of the 2010 Standards is required to
  be provided on fishing piers and platforms.

Commenters expressed
  concerns about the provision for fishing piers and platforms at the exception
  in section 1005.2.1 of the 2010 Standards that allows a maximum height of 42
  inches for a guard when the pier or platform is covered by the IBC. Two
  commenters stated that allowing a 42-inch guard or railing height for
  facilities covered by another building code would be difficult to enforce. They
  also thought that this would hinder access for persons with disabilities
  because the railing height would be too high for a person seated in a
  wheelchair to reach over with their fishing pole in order to fish. The
  Department understands these concerns but believes that the railing height
  exception is necessary in order to avoid confusion resulting from conflicting
  accessibility requirements, and therefore has retained this exception.

#### 238 and 1006 Golf Facilities

**Accessible Route.** Sections
  206.2.15, 1006.2, and 1006.3 of the 2010 Standards require an accessible route
  to connect all accessible elements within the boundary of the golf course and,
  in addition, to connect golf car rental areas, bag drop areas, teeing grounds,
  putting greens, and weather shelters. An accessible route also is required to
  connect any practice putting greens, practice teeing grounds, and teeing
  stations at driving ranges that are required to be accessible. An exception
  permits the accessible route requirements to be met, within the boundaries of
  the golf course, by providing a &quot;golf car passage&quot; (the path typically used by
  golf cars) if specifications for width and curb cuts are met.

Most commenters expressed
  the general viewpoint that nearly all golf courses provide golf cars and have
  either well-defined paths or permit the cars to drive on the course where paths
  are not present, and thus meet the accessible route requirement.

The Department received
  many comments requesting clarification of the term &quot;golf car passage.&quot; Some
  commenters recommended additional regulatory language specifying that an
  exception from a pedestrian route requirement should be allowed only when a
  golf car passage provides unobstructed access onto the teeing ground, putting
  green, or other accessible element of the course so that an accessible golf car
  can have full access to those elements. These commenters cautioned that full
  and equal access would not be provided if a golfer were required to navigate a
  steep slope up or down a hill or a flight of stairs in order to get to the
  teeing ground, putting green, or other accessible element of the course.

Conversely, another
  commenter requesting clarification of the term &quot;golf car passage&quot; argued that
  golf courses typically do not provide golf car paths or pedestrian paths up to
  actual tee grounds or greens, many of which are higher or lower than the car
  path. This commenter argued that if golf car passages were required to extend
  onto teeing grounds and greens in order to qualify for an exception, then some
  golf courses would have to substantially regrade teeing grounds and greens at a
  high cost.

Some commenters argued
  that older golf courses, small nine-hole courses, and executive courses that do
  not have golf car paths would be unable to comply with the accessible route
  requirements because of the excessive cost involved. A commenter noted that,
  for those older courses that have not yet created an accessible pedestrian
  route or golf car passage, the costs and impacts to do so should be considered.

A commenter argued that
  an accessible route should not be required where natural terrain makes it
  infeasible to create an accessible route. Some commenters cautioned that the
  2010 Standards would jeopardize the integrity of golf course designs that
  utilize natural terrain elements and elevation changes to set up shots and
  create challenging golf holes.

The Department has given
  careful consideration to the comments and has decided to adopt the 2010
  Standards requiring that at least one accessible route connect accessible
  elements and spaces within the boundary of the golf course including teeing
  grounds, putting greens, and weather shelters, with an exception provided that
  golf car passages shall be permitted to be used for all or part of required
  accessible routes. In response to requests for clarification of the term &quot;golf
  car passage,&quot; the Department points out that golf car passage is merely a
  pathway on which a motorized golf car can operate and includes identified or
  paved paths, teeing grounds, fairways, putting greens, and other areas of the
  course. Golf cars cannot traverse steps and exceedingly steep slopes. A
  nine-hole golf course or an executive golf course that lacks an identified golf
  car path but provides golf car passage to teeing grounds, putting greens, and
  other elements throughout the course may utilize the exception for all or part
  of the accessible pedestrian route. The exception in section 206.2.15 of the
  2010 Standards does not exempt golf courses from their obligation to provide
  access to necessary elements of the golf course; rather, the exception allows a
  golf course to use a golf car passage for part or all of the accessible
  pedestrian route to ensure that persons with mobility disabilities can fully
  and equally participate in the recreational activity of playing golf.

**Accessible Teeing Grounds, Putting Greens, and Weather Shelters**. Sections 238.2 and 1006.4 of the
  2010 Standards require that golf cars be able to enter and exit each putting
  green and weather shelter. Where two teeing grounds are provided, the forward
  teeing ground is required to be accessible (golf car can enter and exit). Where
  three or more teeing grounds are provided, at least two, including the forward
  teeing ground, must be accessible.

A commenter supported
  requirements for teeing grounds, particularly requirements for accessible
  teeing grounds, noting that accessible teeing grounds are essential to the full
  and equal enjoyment of the golfing experience.

A commenter recommended
  that existing golf courses be required to provide access to only one teeing
  ground per hole. The majority of commenters reported that most public and
  private golf courses already provide golf car passage to teeing grounds and
  greens. The Department has decided that it is reasonable to maintain the
  requirement. The 2010 Standards provide an exception for existing golf courses
  with three or more teeing grounds not to provide golf car passage to the
  forward teeing ground where terrain makes such passage infeasible.

Section 1006.3.2 of the
  2010 Standards requires that where curbs or other constructed barriers prevent
  golf cars from entering a fairway, openings 60 inches wide minimum shall be
  provided at intervals not to exceed 75 yards.

A commenter disagreed
  with the requirement that openings 60 inches wide minimum be installed at least
  every 75 yards, arguing that a maximum spacing of 75 yards may not allow enough
  flexibility for terrain and hazard placements. To resolve this problem, the
  commenter recommended that the standards be modified to require that each golf
  car passage include one 60-inch wide opening for an accessible golf car to
  reach the tee, and that one opening be provided where necessary for an
  accessible golf car to reach a green. The requirement for openings where curbs
  or other constructed barriers may otherwise prevent golf cars from entering a
  fairway allows the distance between openings to be less than every 75 yards.
  Therefore, the Department believes that the language in section 1006.3.2 of the
  2010 Standards allows appropriate flexibility. Where a paved path with curbs or
  other constructed barrier exists, the Department believes that it is essential
  that openings be provided to enable golf car passages to access teeing grounds,
  fairways and putting greens, and other required elements. Golf car passage is
  not restricted to a paved path with curbs. Golf car passage also includes
  fairways, teeing grounds, putting greens, and other areas on which golf cars
  operate.

**Accessible Practice Putting Greens, Practice Teeing Grounds, and Teeing Stations at Driving Ranges.**  Section 238.3 of the 2010 Standards requires that five percent (5%) but at least one of
  each of practice putting greens, practice teeing grounds, and teeing stations
  at driving ranges must permit golf cars to enter and exit.

#### 239 and 1007 Miniature Golf Facilities

**Accessible Route to Miniature Golf Course Holes.** Sections 206.2.16, 239.3, and 1007.2 of the 2010 Standards
  require an accessible route to connect accessible miniature golf course holes
  and the last accessible hole on the course directly to the course entrance or exit.
  Accessible holes are required to be consecutive with an exception permitting
  one break in the sequence of consecutive holes provided that the last hole on
  the miniature golf course is the last hole in the sequence.

Many commenters supported
  expanding the exception from one to multiple breaks in the sequence of
  accessible holes. One commenter noted that permitting accessible holes with
  breaks in the sequence would enable customers with disabilities to enjoy the
  landscaping, water and theme elements of the miniature golf course. Another
  commenter wrote in favor of allowing multiple breaks in accessible holes with a
  connecting accessible route.

Other commenters objected
  to allowing multiple breaks in the sequence of miniature golf holes. Commenters
  opposed to this change argued that allowing any breaks in the sequence of
  accessible holes at a miniature golf course would disrupt the flow of play for
  persons with disabilities and create a less socially integrated experience. A
  commenter noted that multiple breaks in sequence would not necessarily
  guarantee the provision of access to holes that are most representative of
  those with landscaping, water elements, or a fantasy-like experience.

The Department has decided to retain the exception without change. Comments did not provide a
  sufficient basis on which to conclude that allowing multiple breaks in the
  sequence of accessible holes would necessarily increase integration of
  accessible holes with unique features of miniature golf courses. Some designs
  of accessible holes with multiple breaks in the sequence might provide
  equivalent facilitation where persons with disabilities gain access to
  landscaping, water or theme elements not otherwise represented in a consecutive
  configuration of accessible holes. A factor that might contribute to equivalent
  facilitation would be an accessible route designed to bring persons with
  disabilities to a unique feature, such as a waterfall, that would otherwise not
  be served by an accessible route connecting consecutive accessible holes.

Specified exceptions are permitted for accessible route requirements when located on the playing
  surfaces near holes.

**Accessible Miniature Golf Course Holes.**  Sections 239.2 and 1007.3 of the 2010 Standards require at least fifty percent (50%) of golf holes on miniature golf courses to be
  accessible, including providing a clear floor or ground space that is 48 inches
  minimum by 60 inches minimum with slopes not steeper than 1:48 at the start of
  play.

#### 240 and 1008 Play Areas

Section 240 of the 2010
  Standards provides scoping for play areas and section 1008 provides technical
  requirements for play areas. Section 240.1 of the 2010 Standards sets
  requirements for play areas for children ages 2 and over and covers separate
  play areas within a site for specific age groups. Section 240.1 also provides
  four exceptions to the requirements that apply to family child care facilities,
  relocation of existing play components in existing play areas, amusement
  attractions, and alterations to play components where the ground surface is not
  altered.

**Ground Surfaces.** Section
  1008.2.6 of the 2010 Standards provides technical requirements for accessible
  ground surfaces for play areas on accessible routes, clear floor or ground
  spaces, and turning spaces. These ground surfaces must follow special rules,
  incorporated by reference from nationally recognized standards for
  accessibility and safety in play areas, including those issued by the American
  Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM).

A commenter recommended
  that the Department closely examine the requirements for ground surfaces at
  play areas. The Department is
  aware that there is an ongoing controversy about play area ground surfaces
  arising from a concern that some surfaces that meet the ASTM requirements at the
  time of installation will become inaccessible if they do not receive constant
  maintenance. The Access Board is also aware of this issue and is working to
  develop a portable field test that will provide more relevant information on
  installed play surfaces. The Department would caution covered entities
  selecting among the ground surfacing materials that comply with the ASTM
  requirements that they must anticipate the maintenance costs that will be
  associated with some of the products. Permitting a surface to deteriorate so
  that it does not meet the 2010 Standards would be an independent violation of
  the Department&acute;s ADA regulations.

**Accessible Route to Play Components.** Section 206.2.17 of the 2010 Standards provides scoping
  requirements for accessible routes to ground level and elevated play components
  and to soft contained play structures. Sections 240.2 and 1008 of the 2010
  Standards require that accessible routes be provided for play components. The
  accessible route must connect to at least one ground level play component of
  each different type provided (e.g., for different experiences such as rocking,
  swinging, climbing, spinning, and sliding). Table 240.2.1.2 sets requirements
  for the number and types of ground level play components required to be on accessible
  routes. When elevated play components are provided, an accessible route must
  connect at least fifty percent (50%) of the elevated play components. Section
  240.2.1.2, provides an exception to the requirements for ground level play
  components if at least fifty percent (50%) of the elevated play components are
  connected by a ramp and at least three of the elevated play components
  connected by the ramp are different types of play components.

The technical
  requirements at section 1008 include provisions where if three or fewer entry
  points are provided to a soft contained play structure, then at least one entry
  point must be on an accessible route. In addition, where four or more entry
  points are provided to a soft contained play structure, then at least two entry
  points must be served by an accessible route.

If elevated play
  components are provided, fifty percent (50%) of the elevated components are
  required to be accessible. Where 20 or more elevated play components are
  provided, at least twenty five percent (25%) will have to be connected by a
  ramp. The remaining play components are permitted to be connected by a transfer
  system. Where less than 20 elevated play components are provided, a transfer
  system is permitted in lieu of a ramp.

A commenter noted that
  the 2010 Standards allow for the provision of transfer steps to elevated play
  structures based on the number of elevated play activities, but asserted that
  transfer steps have not been documented as an effective means of access.

The 2010 Standards
  recognize that play structures are designed to provide unique experiences and
  opportunities for children. The 2010 Standards provide for play components that
  are accessible to children who cannot transfer from their wheelchair, but they
  also provide opportunities for children who are able to transfer. Children
  often interact with their environment in ways that would be considered
  inappropriate for adults. Crawling and climbing, for example, are integral
  parts of the play experience for young children. Permitting the use of transfer
  platforms in play structures provides some flexibility for creative playground
  design.

**Accessible Play Components.**  Accessible play components are required to be on accessible
  routes, including elevated play components that are required to be connected by
  ramps. These play components must also comply with other accessibility
  requirements, including specifications for clear floor space and seat heights
  (where provided).

A commenter expressed
  concerns that the general requirements of section 240.2.1 of the 2010 Standards
  and the advisory accompanying section 240.2.1 conflict. The comment asserts
  that section 240.2.1 of the 2010 Standards provides that the only requirement
  for integration of equipment is where there are two or more required ground
  level play components, while the advisory appears to suggest that all
  accessible components must be integrated.

The commenter
  misinterprets the requirement. The ADA mandates that persons with disabilities
  be able to participate in programs or activities in the most integrated setting
  appropriate to their needs. Therefore, all accessible play components must be
  integrated into the general playground setting. Section 240.2.1 of the 2010
  Standards specifies that where there is more than one accessible ground level
  play component, the components must be both dispersed and integrated.

#### 241 and 612 Saunas and Steam Rooms

Section 241 of the 2010
  Standards sets scoping for saunas and steam rooms and section 612 sets
  technical requirements including providing accessible turning space and an
  accessible bench. Doors are not permitted to swing into the clear floor or
  ground space for the accessible bench. The exception in section 612.2 of the
  2010 Standards permits a readily removable bench to obstruct the required
  wheelchair turning space and the required clear floor or ground space. Where
  they are provided in clusters, five percent (5%) but at least one sauna or
  steam room in each cluster must be accessible.

Commenters raised
  concerns that the safety of individuals with disabilities outweighs the
  usefulness in providing accessible saunas and steam rooms. The Department
  believes that there is an element of risk in many activities available to the
  general public. One of the major tenets of the ADA is that individuals with
  disabilities should have the same opportunities as other persons to decide what
  risks to take. It is not appropriate for covered entities to prejudge the
  abilities of persons with disabilities.

#### 242 and 1009 Swimming Pools, Wading Pools, and Spas

**Accessible Means of Entry to Pools.**  Section 242 of the 2010 Standards requires at least two
  accessible means of entry for larger pools (300 or more linear feet) and at
  least one accessible entry for smaller pools. This section requires that at
  least one entry will have to be a sloped entry or a pool lift; the other could
  be a sloped entry, pool lift, a transfer wall, or a transfer system (technical
  specifications for each entry type are included at section 1009).

Many commenters supported
  the scoping and technical requirements for swimming pools. Other commenters
  stated that the cost of requiring facilities to immediately purchase a pool
  lift for each indoor and outdoor swimming pool would be very significant
  especially considering the large number of swimming pools at lodging
  facilities. One commenter requested that the Department clarify what would be
  an &quot;alteration&quot; to a swimming pool that would trigger the obligation to comply
  with the accessible means of entry in the 2010 Standards.

Alterations are covered
  by section 202.3 of the 2010 Standards and the definition of &quot;alteration&quot; is
  provided at section 106.5. A physical change to a swimming pool which affects
  or could affect the usability of the pool is considered to be an alteration. Changes
  to the mechanical and electrical systems, such as filtration and chlorination
  systems, are not alterations. Exception 2 to section 202.3 permits an altered
  swimming pool to comply with applicable requirements to the maximum extent
  feasible if full compliance is technically infeasible. &quot;Technically infeasible&quot;
  is also defined in section 106.5 of the 2010 Standards.

The Department also
  received comments suggesting that it is not appropriate to require two
  accessible means of entry to wave pools, lazy rivers, sand bottom pools, and
  other water amusements where there is only one point of entry. Exception 2 of
  Section 242.2 of the 2010 Standards exempts pools of this type from having to
  provide more than one accessible means of entry provided that the one
  accessible means of entry is a swimming pool lift compliant with section
  1009.2, a sloped entry compliant with section 1009.3, or a transfer system
  compliant with section 1009.5 of the 2010 Standards.

**Accessible Means of Entry to Wading Pools.**  Sections 242.3 and 1009.3 of the 2010 Standards require that at least one sloped means of entry is required into the deepest part of
  each wading pool.

**Accessible Means of Entry to Spas.**  Sections 242.4 and 1009.2, 1009.4, and 1009.5 of the 2010
  Standards require spas to meet accessibility requirements, including an
  accessible means of entry. Where spas are provided in clusters, five percent
  (5%) but at least one spa in each cluster must be accessible. A pool lift, a
  transfer wall, or a transfer system will be permitted to provide the required
  accessible means of entry.

#### 243 Shooting Facilities with Firing Positions

Sections 243 and 1010 of
  the 2010 Standards require an accessible turning space for each different type
  of firing position at a shooting facility if designed and constructed on a
  site. Where firing positions are
  provided in clusters, five percent (5%), but at least one position of each type
  in each cluster must be accessible.

### Additional Technical Requirements

#### 302.1 Floor or Ground Surfaces

Both section 4.5.1 of the 1991 Standards and section 302.2 of the 2010 Standards require that floor or
  ground surfaces along accessible routes and in accessible rooms and spaces be
  stable, firm, slip-resistant, and comply with either section 4.5 in the case of
  the 1991 Standards or section 302 in the case of the 2010 Standards.

Commenters recommended that the Department apply an ASTM Standard (with modifications) to assess
  whether a floor surface is &quot;slip resistant&quot; as required by section 302.1 of the
  2010 Standards. The Department declines to accept this recommendation since,
  currently, there is no generally accepted test method for the slip-resistance
  of all walking surfaces under all conditions.

#### 304 Turning Space

 Section 4.2.3 of the 1991
  Standards and Section 304.3 of the 2010 Standards allow turning space to be
  either a circular space or a T-shaped space. Section 304.3 permits turning
  space to include knee and toe clearance complying with section 306. Section
  4.2.3 of the 1991 Standards did not specifically permit turning space to
  include knee and toe clearance. Commenters urged the Department to retain the
  turning space requirement, but exclude knee and toe clearance from being
  permitted as part of this space. They argued that wheelchairs and other mobility
  devices are becoming larger and that more individuals with disabilities are
  using electric three and four-wheeled scooters which cannot utilize knee
  clearance.

The Department recognizes
  that the technical specifications for T-shaped and circular turning spaces in
  the 1991 and 2010 Standards, which are based on manual wheelchair dimensions,
  may not adequately meet the needs of individuals using larger electric
  scooters. However, there is no consensus about the appropriate dimension on
  which to base revised requirements. The Access Board is conducting research to
  study this issue in order to determine if new requirements are warranted. For
  more information, see the Access Board&acute;s website at
  [http://www.access-board.gov/research/current-projects.htm#suny](http://www.access-board.gov/research/current-projects.htm#suny). The Department
  plans to wait for the results of this study and action by the Access Board
  before considering any changes to the Department&acute;s rules. Covered entities may
  wish to consider providing more than the minimum amount of turning space in
  confined spaces where a turn will be required. Appendix section A4.2.3 and Fig.
  A2 of the 1991 Standards provide guidance on additional space for making a
  smooth turn without bumping into surrounding objects.

#### 404 Doors, Doorways, and Gates

**Automatic Door Break Out Openings.** The 1991 Standards do not contain any technical requirement
for automatic door break out openings. The 2010 Standards at sections 404.1,
  404.3, 404.3.1, and 404.3.6 require automatic doors that are part of a means of
  egress and that do not have standby power to have a 32-inch minimum clear break
  out opening when operated in emergency mode. The minimum clear opening width
  for automatic doors is measured with all leaves in the open position. Automatic bi-parting doors or pairs of swinging doors that provide a 32-inch minimum clear break out opening in
  emergency mode when both leaves are opened manually meet the technical
  requirement. Section 404.3.6 of the 2010 Standards includes an exception that
  exempts automatic doors from the technical requirement for break out openings
  when accessible manual swinging doors serve the same means of egress.

**Maneuvering Clearance or Standby Power for Automatic Doors.** Section 4.13.6 of the 1991
  Standards does not require maneuvering clearance at automatic doors. Section
  404.3.2 of the 2010 Standards requires automatic doors that serve as an
  accessible means of egress to either provide maneuvering clearance or to have
  standby power to operate the door in emergencies. This provision has limited
  application and will affect, among others, in-swinging automatic doors that
  serve small spaces.

Commenters urged the
  Department to reconsider provisions that would require maneuvering clearance or
  standby power for automatic doors. They assert that these requirements would
  impose unreasonable financial and administrative burdens on all covered
  entities, particularly smaller entities. The Department declines to change
  these provisions because they are fundamental life-safety issues. The
  requirement applies only to doors that are part of a means of egress that must
  be accessible in an emergency. If an emergency-related power failure prevents
  the operation of the automatic door, a person with a disability could be
  trapped unless there is either adequate maneuvering room to open the door
  manually or a back-up power source.

**Thresholds at Doorways.** The
  1991 Standards, at section 4.13.8, require the height of thresholds at doorways
  not to exceed 1/2 inch and thresholds at exterior sliding doors not to exceed
  3/4 inch. Sections 404.1 and 404.2.5 of the 2010 Standards require the height
  of thresholds at all doorways that are part of an accessible route not to
  exceed 1/2 inch. The 1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards require raised
  thresholds that exceed &frac14; inch in height to be beveled on each side with a
  slope not steeper than 1:2. The 2010 Standards include an exception that
  exempts existing and altered thresholds that do not exceed 3/4 inch in height
  and are beveled on each side from the requirement.

#### 505 Handrails

The 2010 Standards add a
  new technical requirement at section 406.3 for handrails along walking
  surfaces.

The 1991 Standards, at
  sections 4.8.5, 4.9.4, and 4.26, and the 2010 Standards, at section 505,
  contain technical requirements for handrails. The 2010 Standards provide more
  flexibility than the 1991 Standards as follows:

- Section 4.26.4 of the 1991 Standards
requires handrail gripping surfaces to have edges with a minimum radius of 1/8
inch. Section 505.8 of the 2010
Standards requires handrail gripping surfaces to have rounded edges.
- Section 4.26.2 of the 1991 Standards
requires handrail gripping surfaces to have a diameter of 1 &frac14; inches to 1 1/2
inches, or to provide an equivalent gripping surface. Section 505.7 of the 2010 Standards requires handrail gripping
surfaces with a circular cross section to have an outside diameter of 1 &frac14;
inches to 2 inches. Handrail gripping surfaces with a non-circular cross
section must have a perimeter dimension of 4 inches to 6 &frac14; inches, and a
cross section dimension of 2 &frac14; inches maximum.
- Sections 4.8.5 and 4.9.4 of the 1991
Standards require handrail gripping surfaces to be continuous, and to be
uninterrupted by newel posts, other construction elements, or
obstructions. Section 505.3 of the
2010 Standards sets technical requirements for continuity of gripping
surfaces. Section 505.6 requires
handrail gripping surfaces to be continuous along their length and not to be
obstructed along their tops or sides. The bottoms of handrail gripping surfaces
must not be obstructed for more than twenty percent (20%) of their length.
Where provided, horizontal projections must occur at least 1 1/2 inches below
the bottom of the handrail gripping surface. An exception permits the distance
between the horizontal projections and the bottom of the gripping surface to be
reduced by 1/8 inch for each 1/2 inch of additional handrail perimeter
dimension that exceeds 4 inches.
- Section 4.9.4 of the 1991 Standards
requires handrails at the bottom of stairs to continue to slope for a distance
of the width of one tread beyond the bottom riser nosing and to further extend
horizontally at least 12 inches. Section 505.10 of the 2010 Standards requires
handrails at the bottom of stairs to extend at the slope of the stair flight
for a horizontal distance at least equal to one tread depth beyond the last
riser nosing. Section 4.1.6(3) of the 1991 Standards has a special technical
provision for alterations to existing facilities that exempts handrails at the
top and bottom of ramps and stairs from providing full extensions where it will
be hazardous due to plan configuration. Section 505.10 of the 2010 Standards
has a similar exception that applies in alterations.

A commenter noted that
  handrail extensions are currently required at the top and bottom of stairs, but
  the proposed regulations do not include this requirement, and urged the
  Department to retain the current requirement. Other commenters questioned the
  need for the extension at the bottom of stairs.

Sections 505.10.2 and
  505.10.3 of the 2010 Standards require handrail extensions at both the top and
  bottom of a flight of stairs. The requirement in the 1991 Standards that
  handrails extend horizontally at least 12 inches beyond the width of one tread
  at the bottom of a stair was changed in the 2004 ADAAG by the Access Board in
  response to public comments. Existing horizontal handrail extensions that
  comply with 4.9.4(2) of the 1991 Standards should meet or exceed the
  requirements of the 2010 Standards.

Commenters noted that the
  2010 Standards will require handrail gripping surfaces with a circular cross
  section to have an outside diameter of 2 inches, and that this requirement
  would impose a physical barrier to individuals with disabilities who need the
  handrail for stability and support while accessing stairs.

The requirement permits
  an outside diameter of 1 &frac14; inches to 2 inches. This range allows flexibility
  in meeting the needs of individuals with disabilities and designers and
  architects. The Department is not aware
  of any data indicating that an outside diameter of 2 inches would pose any
  adverse impairment to use by individuals with disabilities.

**Handrails Along Walkways.**  The
  1991 Standards do not contain any technical requirement for handrails provided
  along walkways that are not ramps. Section 403.6 of the 2010 Standards
  specifies that where handrails are provided along walkways that are not ramps,
  they shall comply with certain technical requirements. The change is expected
  to have minimal impact.
