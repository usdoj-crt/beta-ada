This guide is part of an ongoing series that showcases key accessibility features supporting
individuals with disabilities in staying active, enjoying sports and fully participating in
recreational spaces across the country.

In this edition, we’re highlighting the following types of recreational spaces:

## Golf Facilities
(Sections [238]({{ '/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#238-golf-facilities' | relative_url }}) and [1006]({{ '/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#1006-golf-facilities' | relative_url }}))
- Golf courses and related facilities must be accessible to all. The design standards outline
key requirements for elements such as accessible paths, golf car routes, and shelters from
the weather.

## Play Areas
(Sections [240]({{ '/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#240-play-areas' | relative_url }}) and [1008]({{ '/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#1008-play-areas' | relative_url }}))
- Children with disabilities must be able to participate in play without barriers. The design
standards detail how play structures including soft play environments, water features, and
play tables, should be accessible.

## Swimming Pools, Wading Pools, and Spas
(Sections [242]({{ '/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#242-swimming-pools-wading-pools-and-spas' | relative_url }}) and [1009]({{ '/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#1009-swimming-pools-wading-pools-and-spas' | relative_url }}))
- Barrier-free access to aquatic facilities is essential. The design standards provide
specifications for features such as pool lifts, sloped entries, transfer walls, transfer
systems, pool stairs and adequate deck space.

## Shooting Facilities with Firing Positions
(Sections [243]({{ '/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#243-shooting-facilities-with-firing-positions' | relative_url }}) and [1010]({{ '/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#1010-shooting-facilities-with-firing-positions' | relative_url }}))

- Whether you’re building a new facility or updating an existing one, it’s important to know the rules. The design standards outline specifications for accessible firing positions and turning space to support safe use by individuals with disabilities.
