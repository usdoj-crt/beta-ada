## Enforcing the ADA

Broadly speaking, our ADA cases involve:

- Employment (Title I)
- State and local governmentsâ€™ services, programs, and activities (Title II)
- Businesses and nonprofits open to the public (Title III)

Our matters are both large and small.  For example, we might work on a nationwide case affecting hundreds of people or a case involving one child in one school.

Our matters also cover a range of disability rights issues and contexts, such as:

- Communication with people with disabilities
- Criminal justice
- Education
- Employment
- Health care
- Physical accessibility
- Segregation of people with disabilities (also known as Olmstead work)
- Service animals
- Technology
- Transportation
- Voting
