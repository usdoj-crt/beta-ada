## Most Viewed Cases

- [In Re Georgia Senate Bill 202](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/re-georgia-senate-bill-202) On January 31, 2024, the Justice Department filed a statement of interest explaining how the ADA's equal opportunity and reasonable modification requirements apply in the voting context. The statement of interest was filed in In Re Georgia SB 202, a consolidated lawsuit challenging restrictions on absentee and in-person voting under Georgia Senate Bill SB 202 (“SB 202”). One of the private lawsuits alleges that SB 202 fails to provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to vote absentee and in-person or make reasonable modifications to avoid disability-based discrimination, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The department’s brief explains that, under the ADA, voters with disabilities must have an equal opportunity to vote by a particular method as do voters without disabilities, and that this equal opportunity requirement is separate from the requirement that public entities make reasonable modifications.

- [Dear Colleague Letter on Online Accessibility at Postsecondary Institutions](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/dear-colleague-letter-online-accessibility-postsecondary-institutions) On May 19, 2023, the Justice Department and the Department of Education jointly issued a Dear Colleague Letter reminding colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions to ensure that their online services, programs, and activities are accessible to people with disabilities. Many colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions increasingly rely on their websites and third-party online platforms to provide services, programs, and activities to members of the public. This includes courses on learning platforms as well as podcasts and videos on social media and third-party platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Podcasts. This joint letter reiterates that Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions to provide equal opportunities to people with disabilities in all their operations. The letter also highlights recent web accessibility enforcement activities and technical assistance from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights.

- [U.S. v. Barnet Dulaney Perkins Eye Center, PC](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/us-v-barnet-dulaney-perkins-eye-center-pc) On December 20, 2021, the United States sued Barnet Dulaney Perkins Eye Center, PC (BDP), an optometry and ophthalmology provider with 24 facilities, for violating Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act by refusing to transfer certain patients with disabilities from wheelchairs onto surgical and exam tables and instead requiring these patients to hire third-party medical support personnel to transport them to and from BDP facilities and to provide transfer assistance at the facilities.

- [U.S. v. MedStar Health, Inc.](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/us-v-medstar-health-inc) On January 30, 2024, the United States filed a Complaint against MedStar Health, Inc., a leading healthcare provider in Maryland and the greater Washington, D.C., region. The lawsuit, filed under Title III of the ADA, alleges that MedStar Health denied people with disabilities equal access to medical care by excluding their necessary support persons. The suit alleges that MedStar Health failed to modify visitor restrictions so that people with certain disabilities, which affected their ability to independently access medical care, could be accompanied by their support persons (such as a family member, companion, or aide). These included individuals with dementia, intellectual disabilities, or autism spectrum disorder whose disabilities prevented them from providing medical history or understanding medical directions. As a result, they were unable to receive equal care without the assistance of their support person. [Learn more](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/us-v-medstar-health-inc)
