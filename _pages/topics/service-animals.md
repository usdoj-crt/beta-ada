  The ADA explains what businesses and state/local governments must do to make sure that they do not discriminate against a member of the public with a disability who uses a service animal.

  Generally, businesses and non-profits that are open to the public as well as state/local governments must allow service animals to go most places where the public can go. This is true even if they have a "no pets" policy.

## About Service Animals

### Service animals are:
{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}Dogs{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Any breed and any size of dog{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Trained to perform a task directly related to a person’s disability{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

### Service animals are not:
{% list cancel %}
{% list_item %}Required to be certified or go through a professional training program{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Required to wear a vest or other ID that indicates they’re a service dog{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Emotional support or comfort dogs, because providing emotional support or comfort is not a task related to a person’s disability{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

{% details More about the difference between emotional support animals and service animals %}
If the dog's mere presence provides comfort, it is not a service animal under the ADA. But if the dog is trained to perform a task related to a person's disability, it is a service animal under the ADA. For example, if the dog has been trained to sense that an anxiety attack is about to happen and take a specific action to help avoid the attack or lessen its impact, the dog is a service animal.
{% enddetails %}

## Examples of Service Animal Tasks

A person who uses a wheelchair may have a dog that is **trained to retrieve objects for them**.

A person with depression may have a dog that is **trained to perform a task to remind them to take their medication**.

A person with PTSD may have a dog that is **trained to lick their hand to alert them to an oncoming panic attack**.

A person who has epilepsy may have a dog that is **trained to detect the onset of a seizure and then help the person remain safe during the seizure**.

## Where Service Animals Can Go

Generally, service animals are allowed to be with their person, even in places that don’t allow pets. For example, service dogs can go into:
- Restaurants
- Shops
- Hospitals
- Schools
- Hotels

The ADA also applies to certain types of housing, including:
- Housing at public and private universities
- Public housing programs run by state, county, and city governments
- Emergency shelters

### Other laws apply to housing

The **Fair Housing Act** applies to many types of housing, both public and privately owned, including housing covered by the ADA. Under the Fair Housing Act, there may be different rules that apply when a resident or applicant with a disability uses a service animal or other animal to assist with their disability. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for administering the Fair Housing Act. Learn more at the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/fair_housing_act_overview) or [contact your Regional Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Office](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/contact_fheo).

### Other laws apply to airplanes

The Air Carrier Access Act, not the ADA, protects the rights of people with disabilities in air travel. For information or to file a complaint, contact the U.S. Department of Transportation, Aviation Consumer Protection Division: 202-366-2220.

### Other rules apply to employment
The [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/disability-discrimination) (EEOC) is responsible for administering the ADA in employment settings.

## Asking if a Dog is a Service Animal
If you are working at a business or state/local government facility and it is unclear to you whether someone’s dog is a service dog, **you may ask for certain information using two questions**.

### You may ask:
{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}Is the dog a service animal required because of a disability?{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}What work or task has the dog been trained to perform?{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

### You are _not_ allowed to:
{% list cancel %}
{% list_item %}
Request any documentation that the dog is registered, licensed, or certified as a service animal
{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}
Require that the dog demonstrate its task, or inquire about the nature of the person’s disability
{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

Because service animals are not required to wear vests, a dog that is wearing a vest is not necessarily a service animal. The dog still needs to be trained to perform a task for a person with a disability to be a service animal.

## When a Service Animal Can Be Kept Out

A business or state/local government does not need to allow a service animal if the dog’s presence would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, programs, or activities provided to the public.

{% details What does <i>fundamentally alter</i> mean? %}
In most settings, a service animal will not fundamentally alter the situation. But in some settings, a service dog could change the nature of the service or program. For example, it may be appropriate to keep a service animal out of an operating room or burn unit where the animal’s presence could compromise a sterile environment. But in general, service animals cannot be restricted from other areas of the hospital where patients or members of the public can go.
{% enddetails %}

Learn more about when a service animal can be kept out in [questions 23-26 in FAQs about service animals and the ADA](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html).

## Asking Someone to Remove Their Service Animal

A business or state/local government can ask someone to remove their service animal if:
- The dog is not housebroken.
- The dog is out of control, and the person cannot get the dog under control.

{% details What does <i>out of control</i> mean?%}
Learn more in [question 27 in <cite>FAQs about service animals and the ADA</cite>](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html#exc).
{% enddetails %}

## State and Local Laws

### State/local governments can:
{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}
Require service dogs to be licensed and vaccinated, if all dogs are required to be licensed and vaccinated
{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Offer <em>voluntary</em> service dog registration programs{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

### State/local governments can't:
{% list cancel %}
{% list_item %}Require certification or registration of service dogs{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Ban a service dog based on its breed{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}
