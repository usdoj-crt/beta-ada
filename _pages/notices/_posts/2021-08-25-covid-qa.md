*“As a Nation, we cannot adequately respond to, and recover from, COVID-19 if we do not protect all of our neighbors. Civil rights protections and responsibilities still apply, even during emergencies. They cannot be waived.”*

-Pamela S. Karlan  Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights

## Common Questions About COVID and the ADA

## Can a business stop me from bringing in my service animal because of the COVID-19 pandemic?

{% list cancel %}
{% list_item %}No.
{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

The [rules for admitting service animals]( {{'/topics/service-animals'| relative_url}}) are the same even during the pandemic.  

A service animal is a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability. The tasks must be directly related to the person’s disability.

A business or a state/local government generally must allow a service animal to
accompany a person with a disability into any area where the public is allowed to go. A service animal cannot be excluded just because staff can provide the same services.  

[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html), the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.

EXAMPLE: A restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating because
of the COVID-19 pandemic. A woman with multiple sclerosis
arrives at the restaurant with her service dog. The restaurant
cannot require the woman to dine outside because of her service
dog.

## Can long COVID be a disability under the ADA?

{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}Yes.
{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

Long COVID can be a disability under the ADA if it [substantially limits one or more major life activities](https://beta.ada.gov/topics/intro-to-ada/#the-ada-protects-people-with-disabilities). There is a wide range of ways that this could present itself.

Some examples include:

- A person with long COVID who has lung damage that causes shortness of breath, fatigue, and related effects is substantially limited in respiratory function, among other major life activities.
- A person with long COVID who has symptoms of intestinal pain, vomiting, and nausea that have lingered for months is substantially limited in gastrointestinal function, among other major life activities.
- A person with long COVID who experiences memory lapses and “brain fog” is substantially limited in brain function, concentrating, and/or thinking.

## Is long COVID always a disability under the ADA?

{% list cancel %}
{% list_item %}No.
{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

An individualized analysis is needed to determine whether a person’s long COVID condition substantially limits the person’s health and daily living.

For more information, see the Department’s [Guidance on &quot;Long COVID&quot; as a Disability Under the ADA, Section 504, and Section 1557](https://www.ada.gov/long_covid_joint_guidance.pdf).
