Soon the Department will be launching a new and improved version of ADA.gov.

## What do these changes mean for users of the ADA sites?

- When users go to ADA.gov they will see the new and improved site.
- The former ADA.gov site will be available at archive.ADA.gov. Archiving the former site simply means that the site will no longer be updated.

## What's different about the new ADA.gov?

The updated version of ADA.gov is designed to better serve the public and help expand access for people with disabilities. It has a new, easy-to-navigate interface, features plain language content with less legal jargon, and is optimized for mobile devices.
