title: ADA Information Line
description: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in everyday activities. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability just as other civil rights laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. The ADA is broken up into five different sections, which are called titles. Different titles set out the requirements for different kinds of organizations.
