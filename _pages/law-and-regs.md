# Laws, Regulations & Standards

## The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The Americans with Disabilities Act was passed by Congress in 1990. It was amended by Congress in 2008. This is the law that protects the civil rights of people with disabilities in many aspects of public life.

For more information about the ADA generally, check out the [Introduction to the Americans with Disabilities Act]( {{'/topics/intro-to-ada'| relative_url}}).

## ADA Regulations

{% details What is a regulation? %}
A regulation (also called a "rule") is a set of requirements issued by a federal agency to implement laws passed by Congress.  When Congress passes laws, many details are often left to federal agencies to flesh out in regulations.  For example, when Congress passed the ADA, it gave DOJ the authority to issue regulations that explain the rights and obligations under Titles II and III of the ADA.
{% enddetails %}

DOJ is responsible for issuing regulations under Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that explain the rights of people with disabilities and the obligations of state/local governments and many businesses to ensure that they do not discriminate against people with disabilities.

For an introduction to Title II of the ADA, see [State and Local Governments]( {{'/topics/title-ii' | relative_url}}).

For an introduction to Title III of the ADA, see [Businesses That Are Open to the Public]( {{'/topics/title-iii' | relative_url}}).

## Design Standards

The Design Standards were adopted in the Titles II and III regulations. The standards set minimum accessibility requirements for newly designed and constructed or altered State and local government facilities, public accommodations, and commercial facilities to be usable by individuals with disabilities.

## Unified Agenda

{% details What is the Unified Agenda? %}
The [Unified Agenda](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/eAgenda/UA_About.myjsp) provides information about federal agenciesâ€™ regulatory priorities and the specific regulations that they plan to issue in the short and long term.
{% enddetails %}
