The work of individuals with disabilities in segregated settings is often highly
regimented and typically offers no opportunity for advancement. In many sheltered
workshops, for example, people with disabilities perform highly repetitive, manual tasks,
such as folding, sorting, and bagging, in shared spaces occupied only by other people
with disabilities. They also often earn extremely low wages when compared to people
with disabilities in integrated employment, resulting in stigmatization and a lack of
economic independence. As long as individuals with disabilities who can and want to
work remain in segregated work or day settings, they will be deprived of an important
opportunity to interact with the community and the community will be deprived of their
talents, skills, and contributions.

When people with disabilities are instead given access to supported employment
services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, they have the
opportunity to live fuller lives, be more integrated into the community, and gain financial
independence to “move proudly into the economic mainstream of American life.” {% fn 1 %}
These opportunities fulfill the core promises of the Americans with Disabilities Act to
“assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-
sufficiency.” {% fn 2 %}

State and local governments that fail to provide services to people with
disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs may be failing to
comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The U.S. Department
of Justice (the Department) has created this guidance to discuss and explain the
requirements of the ADA’s integration mandate and the Supreme Court’s decision in
*Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring*, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), as applied to segregated
employment settings and facility-based day programs.

This guidance complements and supplements, but does not supersede, the Department’s 2011 *Olmstead* guidance, [Statement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and *Olmstead v. L.C.*]({{ '/resources/olmstead-mandate-statement/' | relative_url }})

## The ADA and Its Integration Mandate

In 1990, Congress enacted the ADA “to provide a clear and comprehensive
national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with
disabilities.” {% fn 3 %} In passing the ADA, Congress recognized that “historically, society has
tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some
improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue
to be a serious and pervasive social problem.” {% fn 4 %} Title II of the ADA prohibits public
entities from discriminating against individuals with disabilities in the provision of public
services. {% fn 5 %} The Department’s implementing regulation requires public entities to
“administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate
to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” {% fn 6 %} The Department has consistently
interpreted “the most integrated setting appropriate” to mean one that “enables
individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent
possible . . . .” {% fn 7 %}

In *Olmstead v. L.C.*, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court, interpreting the
ADA’s integration mandate, held that Title II prohibits the unjustified segregation of
individuals with disabilities. The Supreme Court held that public entities are required to
provide community-based services to persons with disabilities when (a) such services
are appropriate; (b) the affected persons do not oppose community-based treatment;
and (c) community-based services can be reasonably accommodated, taking into
account the resources available to the entity and the needs of others who receive
disability services from the entity. {% fn 8 %}

To comply with the ADA’s integration mandate, public entities must make
reasonable modifications to their policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to
avoid discrimination on the basis of disability. {% fn 9 %} The obligation to make reasonable
modifications is not unlimited. A public entity is not required to make requested modifications if it can demonstrate that making the modifications would “fundamentally alter” the nature of the service, program, or activity. {% fn 10 %}

## State and Local Employment and Day Services

Most states offer publicly-funded employment and day programs for eligible
individuals with disabilities. These programs may include services that are available
through multiple state agencies and funding streams, including vocational rehabilitation,
Medicaid, and education agencies. They may be provided in a range of settings,
including sheltered workshops, small group or enclave employment, facility-based day
programs like day habilitation, day treatment, or adult day centers, or typical integrated
workplaces. Supported employment services are provided in mainstream workplaces
typical for employees without disabilities. Integrated day services are characterized by
going out into the community and engaging in activities alongside people without
disabilities.

- <u>“Sheltered workshops”</u> are segregated facilities that primarily or exclusively
employ people with disabilities. Sheltered workshops are usually large,
institutional facilities in which people with disabilities have little or no contact with
non-disabled people besides paid staff. Often wages in sheltered workshops are
extremely low compared to wages paid to people with disabilities in integrated
employment, resulting in stigmatization and a lack of economic independence.
Sometimes these workshops pay wages well below the minimum wage. {% fn 11 %}
- <u>“Small group” or “enclave” employment</u> refers to work performed in regular
business, industry, and community settings by small groups of individuals with
disabilities (typically two to eight) under the supervision of an instructor or service
provider.
- <u>“Facility-based day programs”</u> are programs in which people with disabilities
participate in segregated non-work activities during the day, designed to
habilitate or rehabilitate individuals with disabilities. They can include
psychosocial rehabilitation programs that serve people with mental illness.
- <u>“Supported employment services”</u> allow people with disabilities to work in typical
employment settings where they can interact with non-disabled coworkers,
customers, and peers. Such services include job coaching, job training,
vocational assessment, job discovery, {% fn 12 %} person-centered employment planning, job development, negotiation with prospective employers, benefits counseling,
and other services that enable people with disabilities to succeed in securing and
maintaining employment. These services help individuals with disabilities find
meaningful jobs in the community and receive ongoing support from a team of
professionals.
- <u>“Integrated day services”</u> are not facility-based and allow people with disabilities
to engage in community activities of their choosing where they interact with
people without disabilities. Such services provide access to mainstream social,
educational, recreational, cultural, or other activities.

{% details 1. Does the ADA’s Title II integration mandate apply to public employment and day services? %}
{% fn 13 %}
Yes. Title II of the ADA covers all services, programs, and activities of state and
local government entities. {% fn 14 %} A public entity may violate the ADA’s integration mandate
when it plans, administers, operates, funds, or implements any services—including
employment or day services—in a way that unjustifiably segregates individuals with
disabilities. {% fn 15 %}
{% enddetails %}

{% details 2. What is the most integrated setting under the ADA and <em>Olmstead</em> in the context of public employment and day services? %}
The Department has consistently interpreted “the most integrated employment
setting appropriate” to mean one that “enables individuals with disabilities to interact
with non-disabled people to the fullest extent possible . . ..” {% fn 16 %}

Supported employment services allow people with disabilities to work in typical
jobs in the community like individuals without disabilities. In typical employment
settings, individuals with disabilities work on a full- or part-time basis, at or above
minimum wage, at locations where they interact with individuals without disabilities, with
access to the same opportunities for benefits and advancement that are provided to non-disabled workers. Such settings are commonly referred to as competitive integrated employment settings. Similarly, integrated day services support community
engagement by allowing individuals to engage in self-directed activities of their choosing
in the community, including mainstream recreational, social, educational, cultural, and
athletic activities, or other pastimes that offer meaningful opportunities for learning,
expanding skills, and developing relationships critical to employment and independent
living. {% fn 17 %} By contrast, in segregated employment settings, people with disabilities have
little or no contact with non-disabled people besides paid supervisory staff.

Being fully integrated in a workplace means an individual has an opportunity to
interact regularly and consistently with their non-disabled peers to the same extent as
their non-disabled coworkers. Consistent with Title I of the ADA, an employee with
disabilities should be treated similarly to employees without disabilities and participate
equally in the customary benefits of the workplace. For example, individuals with
disabilities should be compensated equally to their non-disabled peers performing the
same work. {% fn 18 %} They should have the same opportunities as their non-disabled peers,
including opportunities for promotion and advancement; opportunities for privacy,
autonomy, and the ability to manage their work schedules and assignments; access to
the community during breaks; and other employment benefits.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 3. What best practices can state and local governments’ employment service systems adopt to ensure that people with disabilities have access to competitive integrated employment? %}
Research on supported employment services has yielded best practices for
ensuring that individuals with disabilities are able to engage in employment in the most
integrated setting appropriate, including ensuring that employment services are
individualized, sufficiently intense and of sufficient duration, provided in integrated
settings, and designed to achieve competitive integrated employment. {% fn 19 %}

a. <u>Individualization of Services</u>

The success of a person with a disability in competitive integrated employment
often depends on identifying jobs and services that align with the particular person’s
skills, abilities, and interests. Individualization of services is achieved through a process
by which a person with a disability identifies his or her particular interests, preferences,
strengths, skills, and support needs for the purpose of finding, obtaining, and
maintaining employment. This process includes: (1) assessments that evaluate the
individual’s skills, strengths, and support needs in an integrated setting; and (2) person-
centered planning. {% fn 20 %} Individualization typically depends upon a career development
plan developed by a qualified employment professional who is familiar with how to
support people with disabilities in competitive integrated employment and how to
connect a person with a disability with employment opportunities identified in the local
job market. Employment professionals, like job developers and job coaches, typically
identify how an employer’s unmet needs may align with a person’s distinct interests and
capabilities to create a potential employment opportunity. Medicaid home- and
community-based services can help state governments’ employment service systems ensure
that people with disabilities have person-centered plans. {% fn 21 %}

b. <u>Intensity and Duration of Services</u>

To be effective, supported employment services should be provided in a sufficient
amount, intensity, and duration to enable a person with a disability to secure and
maintain employment. The type, amount, and intensity of someone’s services may
change over time, but such services should be provided for a sufficient duration to ensure that the person can continue to succeed and to avoid placing the person at risk
of unnecessary segregation. Supported employment services should be sufficient to
allow individuals to work in a mainstream job for the maximum number of hours
consistent with their abilities and preferences.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 4. What evidence may a person with a disability use to establish that an integrated employment setting is appropriate for them? %}

A person with a disability in a segregated employment or day services setting
may rely on a variety of evidence to establish that an integrated employment setting is
appropriate. An assessment by a qualified public official, like a state vocational
rehabilitation counselor or a healthcare professional, is one option. {% fn 22 %} But this is not the
only method of demonstrating the appropriateness of community-based employment for
a particular individual. For example, appropriateness may also be established with
evidence that:

>(1) people with similar impairments are working in integrated employment
settings;
>(2) the individual has formerly worked in a more integrated employment setting;
or
>(3) the individual currently performs tasks in a sheltered workshop that
demonstrate his or her capability to perform work in a mainstream employment
setting with services. {% fn 23 %}

Such evidence may come from the person’s employment service provider,
community-based organizations that provide supported employment services, former
employers, family members and friends, teachers, or any other relevant sources.
Similarly, evidence from day service or other providers, employers, family members,
friends, or other relevant sources may be used to show that individuals are appropriate
for integrated day services.

Professional research has consistently shown that people with significant
disabilities can work in typical jobs—that is, in competitive integrated employment. {% fn 24 %} In fact, numerous states have adopted Employment First policies that instruct states’
disability service systems to prioritize competitive integrated employment for individuals
with disabilities. {% fn 25 %} Such policies frequently include the directive that state systems must
be driven by the presumption that individuals with disabilities can work, and that not
working should be the exception. {% fn 26 %}
{% enddetails %}

{% details 5. How is a determination made whether an individual does not oppose receiving services in an integrated employment or day services setting? %}

People with disabilities in or at risk of entering segregated employment or day
services settings must have the opportunity to make an informed decision about
whether to work in integrated employment settings. {% fn 27 %} Such individuals have often been
told that they cannot work, and frequently have been tracked away from competitive
integrated employment or steered to sheltered workshops or segregated day programs
directly from secondary school settings. They also may have been absent from the
competitive labor market for long periods of time, or been given scant information about
supported employment services, integrated employment settings, or how individuals can
work in jobs in the community. Consequently, individuals and their families may hesitate
to explore work in an integrated employment setting or they may not ask for or be aware
of supported employment services. Thus, public entities should take affirmative steps to
ensure that individuals have accurate information about integrated employment
opportunities sufficient to make meaningful decisions about where to receive
employment services. Affirmative steps should include:

- providing information about the benefits of working in integrated employment
settings;
- providing vocational and situational assessments, career development
planning, and job discovery in mainstream workplaces;
- arranging peer-to-peer mentoring;
- facilitating visits to job sites;
- conducting job exploration and interest inventories, and providing work
experiences in mainstream job settings; and
- providing benefits counseling to explain the impact of competitive work on an
individual’s public benefits and access to public benefits plans.

Only if an individual declines after a public entity takes these affirmative steps
should the public entity determine that an individual is opposed to integrated
employment or day services. Individuals with disabilities may choose to accept the
services based on the information provided to them but are not required to do so. {% fn 28 %}
{% enddetails %}

{% details 6. Do the ADA’s integration mandate and <em>Olmstead</em> apply to people at serious risk of segregated employment or facility-based day settings? %}

Yes. The ADA’s integration mandate and the *Olmstead* decision extend to
people at serious risk of segregation, and are not limited to individuals currently in
segregated settings. {% fn 29 %} This general principle applies to both employment and day
services in segregated settings. For instance, people with disabilities could show
serious risk of unnecessary segregation if a public entity’s failure to provide supported
employment services would likely lead to placement in a sheltered workshop. A serious
risk of needless segregation may also exist when secondary school students with
disabilities are not provided services to facilitate their post-school transition to adult
supported employment. Individuals who are interested in mainstream employment or
integrated day services are not required to wait until the harm of unnecessary
segregation occurs to receive the protections of the ADA and *Olmstead*.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 7. What remedies address violations of the ADA’s integration mandate in the context of publicly-funded employment and day services? %}

A wide range of remedies may be appropriate to address violations of the ADA’s
integration mandate. In the employment services context, the Department has entered
into settlement agreements with certain states that exemplify remedies that expand the
variety, intensity, and duration of supported employment services. Remedies should
ensure that people with disabilities who are interested in integrated employment can
receive individualized services such as job discovery, person-centered career development planning, benefits counseling, job training, job coaching, and other
ongoing services provided in integrated employment settings. Remedies should also
allow people with disabilities to work in integrated employment settings for the maximum
number of hours consistent with their abilities and preferences. In addition, remedies
should ensure access to integrated day services as an alternative to facility-based day
services for people who are interested in participating in community activities with
people without disabilities when they are not working.

Remedies should be designed so that people in segregated settings or at serious
risk of segregation who are interested in more integrated settings can access the
services necessary to allow them to find, obtain, retain, and advance in employment in
integrated settings. These remedies should also ensure that currently segregated
individuals have information about supported employment services, as well as
opportunities to make informed decisions about working in competitive integrated
employment (through, for example, meeting with people who formerly were in sheltered
workshops and now are working in mainstream workplaces; speaking with community
service providers; and visiting mainstream job sites).

For school-age populations, remedies may include transition planning and pre-
employment transition services for students with disabilities who are preparing to exit
school and begin employment. Examples of transition planning include (1) providing
students with community-based trial work experiences, including paid work experiences,
while in school; (2) crafting career development plans from age 14; and (3) ensuring
that those plans include career goals based on the student’s interests and specific
action steps targeted to help the student achieve those goals. Examples of pre-
employment transition services include (1) job exploration; (2) work-based learning
experiences, which may include in-school or after school opportunities, experiences
outside of the traditional school setting, or internships; (3) counseling on opportunities
for enrollment in comprehensive transition or postsecondary educational programs; and
(4) instruction in self-advocacy.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 8. Does the ADA require an individual with a disability to work in an integrated employment setting or participate in integrated day services? %}

No. Individuals with disabilities may decline to accept a service in the most
integrated setting appropriate for them. {% fn 30 %} State and local governments are not required
to provide community-based services to individuals who oppose receiving those
services. {% fn 31 %} On the other hand, state and local governments have no obligation under
the ADA to provide services in segregated settings.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 9. What is the fundamental alteration defense? %}
A public entity’s obligation under the ADA’s integration mandate and *Olmstead* to
provide services in the most integrated setting is not unlimited, such as in instances
where a public entity can prove that the requested modification to its programs or
services would “fundamentally alter” the nature of the public entity’s service system. {% fn 32 %} To demonstrate that making the requested modification would be a fundamental
alteration, the public entity must prove “that, in the allocation of available resources,
immediate relief for plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State [or
local government] has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse
population of persons with ... disabilities.” {% fn 33 %} It is the public entity’s burden to establish
that the requested modification would fundamentally alter its service system.
{% enddetails %}

Providing compensation and benefits to people with disabilities in an employment setting
that are not equal to those offered to peers without disabilities performing the same job
may also violate Title I or Title III of the ADA or other federal laws. Individual service
provider entities, including sheltered workshops, have obligations not to discriminate
against individuals with disabilities. Title I of the ADA covers employers with 15 or more
employees. As such, Title I’s coverage can include individual service provider entities or
sheltered workshops in their capacity as private employers. Title I prohibits employers
from discriminating on the basis of disability in job application procedures, hiring, firing,
advancement, compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of
employment and requires reasonable accommodations. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Also,
under Title III of the ADA, individuals with disabilities cannot be discriminated against on
the basis of disability in the “full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities,
privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by
any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public
accommodation.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). A “social service center establishment” is a
place of public accommodation, 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(K), and can include an individual
service provider entity or a sheltered workshop. Accordingly, individual service provider
entities may also have obligations not to discriminate against their clients as places of
public accommodation under Title III of the ADA.
