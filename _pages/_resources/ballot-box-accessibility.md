## Introduction

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects the civil rights of people with
disabilities. Title II of the ADA requires state and local governments to ensure that
people with disabilities have a full and equal opportunity to participate in all
government programs,{% fn 1 %} including voting. The ADA applies to all parts of the voting
process, including ballot drop boxes.

## Ballot Drop Box Accessibility

The ADA requires that ballot drop boxes are accessible to people with disabilities. Ballot drop boxes must comply with ADA accessibility standards, known as the 2010 ADA Standards.{% fn 2 %}

To be accessible, a ballot drop box must include:
- **an accessible route** to the ballot drop box
- **an accessible clear floor or ground space** in front of the ballot drop box
- **an accessible** ballot drop box opening

### Accessible Route to Ballot Drop Box

An accessible route must connect the ballot drop box to accessible elements on the site, such as accessible parking spaces, accessible passenger drop-off areas, and an accessible building entrance.

An accessible route has the following features:

{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}Stable, firm, and slip-resistant surface (no grass, gravel, or standing water, for example){% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}No surface openings (such as holes or grate openings) greater than ½ inch wide{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Clear width no less than 36 inches{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Running slope in the direction of travel no greater than 1:20 (5.0%){% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Cross slope no greater than 1:48 (2.08%){% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}No changes in level greater than ½ inch (no steps, for example){% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}No protruding or overhanging objects (such as tree branches){% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

### Accessible Clear Floor or Ground Space in Front of Ballot Drop Box

An accessible clear floor or ground space in front of the ballot drop box has the following features:

{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}At least 30 inches by 48 inches{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Stable, firm, and slip-resistant surface (no grass, gravel, or standing water, for example){% endlist_item %}

{% details ADA Checklist for Polling Places %}
The ADA Checklist for Polling Places (“Polling Places Checklist”), provides guidance to election officials for determining whether a polling place is accessible to voters with disabilities. The Polling Place Checklist can be used along with this guidance to assess elements such as parking, exterior, and interior routes to the ballot drop box, ramps and curb ramps along the routes, and facility entrances. Title II and its regulation, the Polling Place Checklist, and the 2010 ADA Standards are available at [ADA.gov]({{ '/' | relative_url }})
{% enddetails %}

## ADA Checklist for Ballot Drop Boxes

This checklist is designed to provide guidance for determining whether a ballot drop box has basic accessibility features for voters with disabilities and includes the route to the ballot box (Section J) and the ballot drop box features (Section K). Each question below provides citations to the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design. Please review the 2010 ADA Standards for all requirements. This ballot drop box checklist can be used with the ADA Checklist for Polling Places (Polling Place Checklist) to ensure the accessibility of other features at the site, such as parking and passenger drop-off areas (Sections A-I). This checklist, the Polling Place Checklist, the Title II regulation, and the 2010 ADA Standards are available at [ADA.gov]({{ '/' | relative_url }}).

The 2010 ADA Standards apply to building or site elements that are “fixed.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(d). Fixed means built-in, bolted, secured, or chained in place, and includes elements like the route and ground space in front of the drop box. For a ballot drop box that is not fixed, elements such as the reach range to the opening to put the ballot in the drop box or the usability of a handle, are not covered by the 2010 ADA Standards specifically. Instead, the Title II regulation applies, and the 2010 ADA Standards are used as a guide. For more information, the Title II regulation, 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, can be found at [ADA Laws and Regulations]({{'/law-and-regs/regulations/title-ii-2010-regulations' | relative_url}}) and the 2010 ADA Standards, 28 C.F.R. § 35.104, are available at [Design Standards]({{'/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds' | relative_url}}) .
