description: A publication within the Business Brief series explaining methods and requirements of providing effective communication at a gas stations.
lead: People with disabilities may find it difficult or impossible to obtain gas for their vehicle because they are unable to use the controls, hose, or nozzle of a self serve gas pump. At stations that offer only self service, they may be unable to purchase gas. At stations that offer both self service and full service, people with disabilities may have no choice but to purchase the more expensive fuel from a full-service pump.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires gas stations to provide equal access for their customers with disabilities. If necessary to provide access, stations must —

- Provide refueling assistance upon the request of an individual with a disability. A service station or convenience store is not required to provide such service at any time that it is operating on a remote control basis with a single employee, but is encouraged to do so, if feasible.

- Let customers know (e.g., using signs or notification on or near pumps) that individuals with disabilities can obtain refueling assistance by honking their horn or otherwise signaling an employee. Some stations provide a call button.

- Provide the refueling assistance without any charge beyond the self-serve price, if the customer wants only fuel. The attendant may provide assistance at a self-service pump or at a full-service pump. In either case, the customer must be charged the self-service price.
