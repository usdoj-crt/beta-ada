Standardized examinations and other high-stakes tests are gateways to educational and employment opportunities.  Whether seeking admission to a high school, college, or graduate program, or attempting to obtain a professional license or certification for a trade, it is difficult to achieve such goals without sitting for some kind of standardized exam or high-stakes test.  While many testing entities have made efforts to ensure equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities, the Department continues to receive questions and complaints relating to excessive and burdensome documentation demands, failures to provide needed testing accommodations, and failures to respond to requests for testing accommodations in a timely manner.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ensures that individuals with disabilities have the opportunity to fairly compete for and pursue such opportunities by requiring testing entities to offer exams in a manner accessible to persons with disabilities.  When needed testing accommodations are provided, test-takers can demonstrate their true aptitude.

The Department of Justice (Department) published revised final regulations implementing the ADA for title II (State and local government services) and title III (public accommodations and commercial facilities) on September 15, 2010.  These rules clarify and refine issues that have arisen over the past 20 years and contain new and updated requirements.

## Overview

This publication provides technical assistance on testing accommodations for individuals with disabilities who take standardized exams and other high-stakes tests.  It addresses the obligations of testing entities, which include private, state, or local government entities that offer exams related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary (high school), postsecondary (college and graduate school), professional (law, medicine, etc.), or trade (cosmetology, electrician, etc.) purposes.  Who is entitled to testing accommodations, what types of testing accommodations must be provided, and what documentation may be required of the person requesting testing accommodations are also discussed.

## What Kinds Of Tests Are Covered?

**Exams  administered by any private, state, or local government entity related to  applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or  postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes are covered by the ADA  and testing accommodations, pursuant to the ADA, must be provided.** {% fn 1 %}


Examples of covered exams include:

- High school equivalency exams (such as the GED);
- High school entrance exams (such as the SSAT or ISEE);
- College entrance exams (such as the SAT or ACT);
- Exams for admission to professional schools (such as the LSAT or MCAT);
- Admissions exams for graduate schools (such as the GRE or GMAT); and
- Licensing exams for trade purposes (such as cosmetology) or professional purposes (such as bar exams or medical licensing exams, including clinical assessments).

## What Are Testing Accommodations?

**Testing  accommodations are changes to the regular testing environment and auxiliary  aids and services {% fn 2 %} that allow individuals with disabilities to demonstrate their true aptitude or  achievement level on standardized exams or other high-stakes tests.**

Examples  of the wide range of testing accommodations that may be required include:

- Braille or large-print exam booklets;
- Screen reading technology;
- Scribes to transfer answers to Scantron bubble sheets or record dictated notes and essays;
- Extended time;
- Wheelchair-accessible testing stations;
- Distraction-free rooms;
- Physical prompts (such as for individuals with hearing impairments); and
- Permission to bring and take medications during the exam (for example, for individuals with diabetes who must monitor their blood sugar and administer insulin).

## Who Is Eligible To Receive Testing Accommodations?

**Individuals with  disabilities are eligible to receive necessary testing accommodations.**  Under the ADA, an individual with a  disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that  substantially limits a major life activity (such as seeing, hearing, learning,  reading, concentrating, or thinking) or a major bodily function (such as the  neurological, endocrine, or digestive system).  The determination of whether an individual has a  disability generally should  not demand extensive analysis and must be made without regard to any positive effects  of measures such as medication, medical supplies or equipment, low-vision  devices (other than ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses), prosthetics, hearing  aids and cochlear implants, or mobility devices.   However, negative  effects, such as side effects of medication or burdens associated with  following a particular treatment regimen, may be considered when determining  whether an individual’s impairment substantially limits a major life activity.

**A substantial  limitation of a major life activity may be based on the extent to which the impairment  affects the condition, manner, or duration in which the individual performs the  major life activity.**  To be &ldquo;substantially limited&rdquo; in a major life  activity does not require that the person be unable to perform the  activity.  In determining whether an  individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, it may be useful  to consider, when compared to most people in the general population, the  conditions under which the individual performs the activity or the manner in  which the activity is performed.  It may  also be useful to consider the length of time an individual can perform a major  life activity or the length of time it takes an individual to perform a major  life activity, as compared to most people in the general population.  For example:

- The  condition or manner under which an individual who has had a hand amputated  performs manual tasks may be more cumbersome, or require more effort or time, than  the way most people in the general population would perform the same tasks.
- The  condition or manner under which someone with coronary artery disease performs  the major life activity of walking would be substantially limited if the  individual experiences shortness of breath and fatigue when walking distances  that most people could walk without experiencing such effects.
- A  person whose back or leg impairment precludes him or her from sitting for more  than two hours without significant pain would be substantially limited in sitting,  because most people can sit for more than two hours without significant pain.

**A person with a history of academic success may still be a  person with a disability who is entitled to testing accommodations under the  ADA.**   A history of academic success does not mean that a person does not have  a disability that requires testing accommodations.  For example, someone with a learning  disability may achieve a high level of academic success, but may nevertheless be  substantially limited in one or more of the major life activities of reading,  writing, speaking, or learning, because of the additional time or effort he or  she must spend to read, write, speak, or learn compared to most people in the  general population.

## What Testing Accommodations Must Be Provided?

**Testing  entities must ensure that the test scores of individuals with disabilities accurately  reflect the individual&rsquo;s aptitude or achievement level or whatever skill the  exam or test is intended to measure.**  A  testing entity must administer its exam so that it accurately reflects an  individual&rsquo;s aptitude, achievement level, or the skill that the exam purports  to measure, rather than the individual&rsquo;s impairment (except where the impaired  skill is one the exam purports to measure).{% fn 3 %}

- **Example:** An individual may be entitled to the use of a basic calculator during  exams as a testing accommodation.  If the  objective of the test is to measure one’s ability to solve algebra equations,  for example, and the ability to perform basic math computations (e.g.,  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), is secondary to the  objective of the test, then a basic calculator may be an appropriate testing  accommodation.  If, however, the  objective of the test is to measure the individual’s understanding of, and  ability to perform, math computations, then it likely would not be appropriate  to permit a calculator as a testing accommodation.

## What Kind Of Documentation Is Sufficient To Support A Request For Testing Accommodations?

All testing entities must adhere to the following principles  regarding what may and may not be required when a person with a disability  requests a testing accommodation.

- **Documentation.  Any documentation if required by a testing entity in support of a request for testing accommodations must be reasonable and limited to the need for the requested testing accommodations.**  Requests for supporting documentation should be narrowly tailored to the information needed to determine the nature of the candidate’s disability and his or her need for the requested testing accommodation.  Appropriate documentation will vary depending on the nature of the disability and the specific testing accommodation requested.

Examples of types of documentation include:

- Recommendations of qualified professionals;
- Proof of past testing  accommodations;
- Observations by educators;
- Results of psycho-educational or  other professional evaluations;
- An applicant&rsquo;s history of  diagnosis; and
- An applicant&rsquo;s statement of his or  her history regarding testing accommodations.

Depending on the particular  testing accommodation request and the nature of the disability, however, a  testing entity may only need one or two of the above documents to determine the  nature of the candidate’s disability and his or her need for the requested  testing accommodation.  If so, a testing  entity should generally limit its request for documentation to those one or two  items and should generally evaluate the testing accommodation request based on  those limited documents without requiring further documentation.

- **Past Testing Accommodations.  Proof of past testing accommodations in similar test settings is generally sufficient to support a request for the same testing accommodations for a current standardized exam or other high-stakes test**.
- **Past Testing Accommodations on Similar Standardized Exams or  High-Stakes Tests.**  If a candidate requests the same testing  accommodations he or she previously received on a similar standardized exam or high-stakes  test, provides proof of having received the previous testing accommodations, and  certifies his or her current need for the testing accommodations due to  disability, then a testing entity should generally grant the same testing  accommodations for the current standardized exam or high-stakes test without  requesting further documentation from the candidate.  So, for example, a person with a disability  who receives a testing accommodation to sit for the SAT should generally get  the same testing accommodation to take the GRE, LSAC, or MCAT.

- **Formal Public School Accommodations. If a candidate  previously received testing accommodations under an Individualized Education  Program (IEP)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> or a Section 504 Plan,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> he or she should generally receive the same testing accommodations for a  current standardized exam or high-stakes test.**  If a  candidate shows the receipt of testing accommodations in his or her most recent  IEP or Section 504 Plan, and certifies his or her current need for the testing  accommodations due to disability, then a testing entity should generally grant those  same testing accommodations for the current standardized exam or high-stakes  test without requesting further documentation from the candidate.  This would include students with disabilities  publicly-placed and funded in a private school under the IDEA or Section 504  placement procedures whose IEP or Section 504 Plan addresses needed testing accommodations.

- **Example.**  Where a student with a Section 504  Plan in place since middle school that includes the testing accommodations of  extended time and a quiet room is seeking those same testing accommodations for  a high-stakes test, and certifies that he or she still needs those testing  accommodations, the testing entity receiving such documentation should generally  grant the request.

- **Private  School Testing Accommodations.  If a  candidate received testing accommodations in private school for similar tests  under a formal policy, he or she should generally receive the same testing  accommodations for a current standardized exam or high-stakes test.**  Testing accommodations are generally provided to a  parentally-placed private school student with disabilities pursuant to a formal  policy and are documented for that particular student.  If a candidate shows a consistent history of having  received testing accommodations for similar tests, and certifies his or her  current need for the testing accommodations due to disability, then a testing  entity should generally grant those same testing accommodations for the current  standardized exam or high-stakes test without requesting further documentation  from the candidate.

- **Example.**  A private school student received a large-print  test and a scribe as testing accommodations on similar tests throughout high  school pursuant to a formal, documented accommodation policy and plan.  Where the student provides documentation of  receiving these testing accommodations, and certifies that he or she still  needs the testing accommodations due to disability, a testing entity should generally  grant the candidate&rsquo;s request for the same testing accommodations without requesting further documentation.

- **First Time Requests or Informal Classroom Testing Accommodations.  An absence of previous formal testing accommodations does not preclude a candidate from receiving testing accommodations.**  Candidates who are individuals with disabilities and have never previously received testing accommodations may also be entitled to receive them for a current standardized exam or high-stakes test.  In the absence of documentation of prior testing accommodations, testing entities should consider the entirety of a candidate&rsquo;s history, including informal testing accommodations,to determine whether that history indicates a current need for testing accommodations.

- **Example.**  A high school senior is in a car accident  that results in a severe concussion.  The  report from the treating specialist says that the student has post-concussion  syndrome that may take up to a year to resolve, and that while his brain is  healing he will need extended time and a quiet room when taking exams.  Although the student has never previously  received testing accommodations, he may nevertheless be entitled to the requested  testing accommodations for standardized exams and high-stakes tests as long as  the post-concussion syndrome persists.

- **Example.**  A student with a diagnosis of ADHD and an  anxiety disorder received informal, undocumented testing accommodations  throughout high school, including time to complete tests after school or at  lunchtime.  In support of a request for  extended time on a standardized exam, the student provides documentation of her  diagnoses and their effects on test-taking in the form of a doctor&rsquo;s letter; a  statement explaining her history of informal classroom accommodations for the  stated disabilities; and certifies that she still needs extended time due to  her disabilities.  Although the student  has never previously received testing accommodations through an IEP, Section  504 Plan, or a formal private school policy, she may nevertheless be entitled  to extended time for the standardized exam.

- **Qualified Professionals.  Testing entities should defer to documentation from a qualified professional  who has made an individualized assessment of the candidate that supports the  need for the requested testing accommodations.**  Qualified professionals are licensed  or otherwise properly credentialed and possess expertise in the disability for  which modifications or accommodations are sought.  Candidates who submit documentation (such  as reports, evaluations, or letters) that is based on careful consideration of  the candidate by a qualified professional should not be required by testing  entities to submit additional documentation.   A testing entity should generally  accept such documentation and provide the recommended testing accommodation  without further inquiry.

- Reports from qualified professionals  who have evaluated the candidate should take precedence over reports from testing  entity reviewers who have never conducted the requisite assessment of the  candidate for diagnosis and treatment.   This is especially important for individuals  with learning disabilities because face-to-face interaction is a critical  component of an accurate evaluation, diagnosis, and determination of  appropriate testing accommodations.

- A qualified professional&rsquo;s decision  not to provide results from a specific test or evaluation instrument should not  preclude approval of a request for testing accommodations where the documentation  provided by the candidate, in its entirety, demonstrates that the candidate has  a disability and needs a requested testing accommodation.  For example, if a candidate submits  documentation from a qualified professional that demonstrates a consistent  history of a reading disorder diagnosis and that recommends the candidate  receive double time on standardized exams based on a personal evaluation of the  candidate, a testing entity should provide the candidate with double time.  This is true even if the qualified  professional does not include every test or subtest score preferred by the  testing entity in the psychoeducational or neuropsychological report.

## How Quickly Should A Testing Entity  Respond To A Request For Testing Accommodations?

 **A testing entity  must respond in a timely manner to requests for testing accommodations so as to  ensure equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities.**  Testing entities should ensure that  their process for reviewing and approving testing accommodations responds in  time for applicants to register and prepare for the test.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>  In addition, the process should provide  applicants with a reasonable opportunity to respond to any requests for  additional information from the testing entity, and still be able to take the  test in the same testing cycle.  Failure  by a testing entity to act in a timely manner, coupled with seeking unnecessary  documentation, could result in such an extended delay that it constitutes a  denial of equal opportunity or equal treatment in an examination setting for  persons with disabilities.  
## How  Should Testing Entities Report Test Scores for Test-Takers Receiving  Disability-Related Accommodations?

**Testing  entities should report accommodated scores in the same way they report scores  generally.**  Testing entities must not decline to report  scores for test-takers with disabilities receiving accommodations under the  ADA.

**Flagging  policies that impede individuals with disabilities from fairly competing for  and pursuing educational and employment opportunities are prohibited by the  ADA.**  &ldquo;Flagging&rdquo; is the policy of  annotating test scores or otherwise reporting scores in a manner that indicates  the exam was taken with a testing accommodation.  Flagging announces to anyone receiving the  exam scores that the test-taker has a disability and suggests that the scores  are not valid or deserved.  Flagging also  discourages test-takers with disabilities from exercising their right to  testing accommodations under the ADA for fear of discrimination.  Flagging must not be used to circumvent the  requirement that testing entities provide testing accommodations for persons  with disabilities and ensure that the test results for persons with  disabilities reflect their abilities, not their disabilities.
