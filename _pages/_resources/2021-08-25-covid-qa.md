*“As a Nation, we cannot adequately respond to, and recover from, COVID-19 if we do not protect all of our neighbors. Civil rights protections and responsibilities still apply, even during emergencies. They cannot be waived.”*

## Can long COVID be a disability under the ADA?

{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}Yes.
{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

Long COVID can be a disability under the ADA if it [substantially limits one or more major life activities]( {{'/topics/intro-to-ada/'| relative_url}}). There is a wide range of ways that this could present itself.

Some examples include:

- A person with long COVID who has lung damage that causes shortness of breath, fatigue, and related effects is substantially limited in respiratory function, among other major life activities.
- A person with long COVID who has symptoms of intestinal pain, vomiting, and nausea that have lingered for months is substantially limited in gastrointestinal function, among other major life activities.
- A person with long COVID who experiences memory lapses and “brain fog” is substantially limited in brain function, concentrating, and/or thinking.
