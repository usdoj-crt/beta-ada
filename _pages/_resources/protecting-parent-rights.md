The United States  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) are issuing this technical assistance to assist state and local child welfare agencies and courts to ensure that the welfare of children and  families is protected in a manner that also protects the civil rights of  parents and prospective parents{% fn 1 %} with disabilities.  This guidance  provides an overview of the issues and application of civil rights laws,  answers to specific questions and implementation examples for child welfare  agencies and courts, and resources to consult for additional information.

Section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504){% fn 2 %} and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA){% fn 3 %} protect parents and prospective parents with disabilities from unlawful  discrimination in the administration of child welfare programs, activities, and  services.{% fn 4 %}  At the same time, child welfare agencies and  courts have the responsibility to protect children from abuse and neglect.  The goals of child welfare and disability  non-discrimination are mutually attainable and complementary.  For example, ensuring that parents and  prospective parents with disabilities have equal access to parenting  opportunities increases the opportunities for children to be placed in safe and  caring homes.

## Need for This Technical Assistance

Both the HHS Office  for Civil Rights (OCR) and DOJ Civil Rights Division have received numerous  complaints of discrimination from individuals with disabilities involved with  the child welfare system, and the frequency of such complaints is rising.  In the course of their civil rights  enforcement activities, OCR and DOJ have found that child welfare agencies and  courts vary in the extent to which they have implemented policies, practices,  and procedures to prevent discrimination against parents and prospective  parents with disabilities in the child welfare system.

For example, in a recent joint investigation by OCR and DOJ  of practices of a State child welfare agency, OCR and DOJ determined that the State  agency engaged in discrimination against a parent with a disability.{% fn 5 %}  The investigation arose from a complaint that  a mother with a developmental disability was subject to discrimination on the  basis of her disability because the State did not provide her with supports and  services following the removal of her two-day-old infant.  The supports and services provided and made  available to nondisabled parents were not provided to this parent, and she was  denied reasonable modifications to accommodate her disability.  As a result, this family was separated for more  than two years.

These issues are  long-standing and widespread.  According  to a comprehensive 2012 report from the National Council on Disability (NCD),  parents with disabilities are overly, and often inappropriately, referred to  child welfare services, and once involved, are permanently separated at  disproportionately high rates.{% fn 6 %}  In a review of research studies and other  data, NCD concluded that among parents with disabilities, parents with  intellectual disabilities and parents with psychiatric disabilities face the  most discrimination based on stereotypes, lack of individualized assessments,  and failure to provide needed services.{% fn 7 %}  Parents who are blind or deaf also report  significant discrimination in the custody process, as do parents with other  physical disabilities.{% fn 8 %}  Individuals with disabilities seeking to  become foster or adoptive parents also encounter bias and unnecessary barriers  to foster care and adoption placements based on speculation and stereotypes  about their parenting abilities.{% fn 9 %}

Discriminatory  separation of parents from their children can result in long-term negative  consequences to both parents and their children.  In addition to the OCR and DOJ case where a  mother and daughter were deprived of the opportunity for maternal/child bonding  for two years, the National Council on Disability report is replete with case  studies with similar consequences.  For  example, a child welfare agency removed a newborn for 57 days from a couple  because of assumptions and stereotypes about their blindness, undermining  precious moments for the baby and parents that can never be replaced.{% fn 10 %} Similarly, after a child welfare agency removed  a three-year-old from his grandmother because she had arthritis and a mobility  disability, the toddler developed behavioral issues and progressively detached  from his grandmother, though he had had no such experiences before this  separation.{% fn 11 %}   Any case  of discrimination against parents and caregivers due to their disability is not acceptable.

## Role of HHS and DOJ

The Children&rsquo;s Bureau in the HHS Administration for Children  and Families administers funding for child welfare agencies and courts and provides  guidance and technical assistance to child welfare agencies regarding child  welfare law.  HHS OCR is responsible for  ensuring that entities receiving Federal financial assistance from HHS,  including child welfare agencies and state courts, comply with their legal  obligation under Section 504 to provide equal access to child welfare services  and activities in a nondiscriminatory manner.   In addition, both DOJ and HHS OCR enforce Title II of the ADA against  public entities, including child welfare agencies and state courts.

## Overview of Legal Requirements

### Title II of the ADA

Title II of the ADA  provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of  such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of  the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to  discrimination by such entity.{% fn 12 %}  Title II of the ADA applies to the services,  programs, and activities of all state and local governments throughout the  United States, including child welfare agencies and court systems.{% fn 13 %}  The &ldquo;services, programs, and activities&rdquo;  provided by public entities include, but are not limited to, investigations,  assessments, provision of in-home services, removal of children from their  homes, case planning and service planning, visitation, guardianship, adoption,  foster care, and reunification services.  &ldquo;Services, programs, and activities&rdquo; also  extend to child welfare hearings, custody hearings, and proceedings to terminate  parental rights.

### Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act

Section 504 provides  that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such  disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the  services, programs, or activities of any entity that receives Federal financial  assistance, or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.{% fn 14 %} Federal financial assistance includes grants,  loans, and reimbursements from Federal agencies, including assistance provided  to child welfare agencies and the courts.{% fn 15 %}  An entity can be a recipient of Federal  financial assistance either directly or as a sub-recipient.{% fn 16 %}  Section 504 applies to all of the operations  of agencies and sub-agencies of state and local governments, even if Federal  financial assistance is directed to one component of the agency or for one  purpose of the agency.{% fn 17 %}  Recipients of Federal financial assistance  must agree to comply with Section 504, and generally other civil rights laws, as  a condition of receiving Federal financial assistance.{% fn 18 %}

### Application

A child welfare  agency or court may not, directly or through contract or other arrangements,  engage in practices or methods of administration that have the effect of  discriminating on the basis of disability, or that have the purpose or effect  of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the  child welfare agency&rsquo;s or court&rsquo;s program for persons with disabilities.{% fn 19 %}  Under these prohibitions, a child welfare  agency could be responsible for the discriminatory actions of a private foster  care or adoption agency with which it contracts when those actions are taken in  fulfillment of the private entity&rsquo;s contractual obligations with the child  welfare agency.  For example, if the  private foster care or adoption agency imposed discriminatory eligibility  requirements for foster or adoptive parents that screened out prospective  parents with HIV, the state child welfare agency would most likely be  responsible for the contractor&rsquo;s practice of discriminating on the basis of  disability.

Two principles that are fundamental to Title  II of the ADA and Section 504 are:

(1) individualized treatment; and (2) full and  equal opportunity.  Both of these  principles are of particular importance to the administration of child welfare  programs.

*Individualized treatment.*  Individuals  with disabilities must be treated on a case-by-case basis consistent with facts  and objective evidence.{% fn 20 %}  Persons with disabilities may not be treated  on the basis of generalizations or stereotypes.{% fn 21 %}  For example, prohibited treatment would  include the removal of a child from a parent with a disability based on the  stereotypical belief, unsupported by an individual assessment, that people with  disabilities are unable to safely parent their children.  Another example would be denying a person  with a disability the opportunity to become a foster or adoptive parent based  on stereotypical beliefs about how the disability may affect the individual&rsquo;s  ability to provide appropriate care for a child.

*Full and equal opportunity*.  Individuals  with disabilities must be provided opportunities to benefit from or participate  in child welfare programs, services, and activities that are equal to those  extended to individuals without disabilities.{% fn 22 %}  This principle can require the provision of  aids, benefits, and services different from those provided to other parents and  prospective parents where necessary to ensure an equal opportunity to obtain  the same result or gain the same benefit, such as family reunification.{% fn 23 %}

This does not mean  lowering standards for individuals with disabilities; rather, in keeping with the  requirements of individualized treatment, services must be adapted to meet the  needs of a parent or prospective parent who has a disability to provide  meaningful and equal access to the benefit.{% fn 24 %}  In some cases, it may mean ensuring physical  or programmatic accessibility or providing auxiliary aids and services to  ensure adequate communication and participation, unless doing so would result in  a fundamental alteration to the nature of the program or undue financial and  administrative burden.{% fn 25 %}  For example, a child welfare agency  must provide an interpreter for a father who is deaf when necessary to ensure  that he can participate in all aspects of the child welfare interaction.  In other  instances, this may mean making reasonable modifications to policies,  procedures, or practices, unless doing so would result in a fundamental  alteration to the nature of the program.{% fn 26 %} For example, if a child welfare agency  provides classes on feeding and bathing children and a mother with an  intellectual disability needs a different method of instruction to learn the  techniques, the agency should provide the mother with the method of teaching  that she needs.

Under Title II of the ADA or Section 504, in some cases, a  parent or prospective parent with a disability may not be appropriate for child  placement because he or she poses a significant risk to the health or safety of  the child that cannot be eliminated by a reasonable modification.{% fn 27 %}  This exception is consistent with the  obligations of child welfare agencies and courts to ensure the safety of  children.  However, both the ADA and  Section 504 require that decisions about child safety and whether a parent or  prospective parent represents a threat to safety must be based on an  individualized assessment and objective facts, including the nature, duration,  and severity of the risk to the child, and the probability that the potential  injury to the child will actually occur.{% fn 28 %}  In addition, if the risk can be eliminated by  a reasonable modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the  provision of auxiliary aids or services, the child welfare agency must take  such mitigating actions.{% fn 29 %}  A public entity may impose legitimate safety  requirements necessary for the safe operation of its services, programs, or  activities, but they may not be based on stereotypes or generalizations about  persons with disabilities.{% fn 30 %}

By applying these  principles consistently in the child welfare system, child welfare agencies and  courts can ensure that parents and prospective parents with disabilities have  equal access to parenting opportunities while ensuring children safely remain  in or are placed in safe and caring homes.  The attached Questions and Answers  provide more detailed information and specific implementation examples for  child welfare agencies and courts.

{% include expand-accordions-wrapper.html expand-heading='Questions and Answers' %}

{% details 1. What are the basic requirements of ADA Title II and Section 504? expandable %}
**Answer:** Title  II of the ADA provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by  reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the  benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in, the services, programs, or  activities of state and local government entities.{% fn 31 %}  Section 504 similarly prohibits  discrimination on the basis of disability against qualified individuals with a  disability in programs, services, and activities receiving Federal financial  assistance.{% fn 32 %}

Under the ADA and Section 504, programs cannot deny people  with disabilities an opportunity to participate,{% fn 33 %} and must provide people with disabilities with meaningful and equal access to  programs, services, and activities.{% fn 34 %}  Programs and services must be accessible to  and usable by people with disabilities.{% fn 35 %}  In addition, programs must provide people  with disabilities with an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from  the programs, services and activities of the entity;{% fn 36 %} they  are also prohibited from using methods of program administration, which  includes written rules as well as agency practices, that have a discriminatory  effect on individuals with disabilities.{% fn 37 %}  Moreover, programs must provide reasonable  modifications in policies, practices, and procedures when necessary to avoid discrimination;{% fn 38 %}  and must take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with applicants,  participants, members of the public, and companions with disabilities are as  effective as communications with others through the provision of auxiliary aids  and services.{% fn 39 %}
{% enddetails %}

### Who is protected by disability nondiscrimination laws?

{% details 2. Who is considered a person with a disability  under Title II of the ADA and Section 504? expandable %}
**Answer**:  The ADA and Section 504 protect the rights of  individuals with disabilities.{% fn 40 %}  A &ldquo;disability&rdquo; is defined as a physical or  mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, such as caring  for oneself, performing manual tasks, breathing, standing, lifting, bending,  speaking, walking, reading, thinking, learning, concentrating, seeing, hearing,  eating, sleeping, or working.{% fn 41 %}  Major life activities also include the  operation of major bodily functions, including but not limited to, functions of  the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, or bladder, neurological,  brain, and respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.{% fn 42 %}

Congress has made clear that the definition of disability in  the ADA and Section 504 is to be interpreted broadly.{% fn 43 %}  Even if an individual&rsquo;s substantially  limiting impairment can be mitigated through the use of medication; medical  supplies, equipment, and devices; learned behavioral or adaptive neurological  modifications; assistive technology (e.g. a person with a hearing disability  who uses hearing aids that substantially restores the sense of hearing); or  reasonable modifications to policies, practices, or procedures, the individual  is still protected by the ADA and Section 504.{% fn 44 %} The ADA and Section 504 also apply to people  who have a record of having a substantial impairment (e.g., medical, military,  or employment records denoting such an impairment), or are regarded as having  such an impairment, regardless of actually having an impairment.{% fn 45 %}

An &ldquo;individual with a disability&rdquo; under the ADA and Section  504 does not include an individual who is currently engaged in the illegal use  of drugs, when the state or local government program or program receiving Federal  financial assistance acts on the basis of the illegal drug use.{% fn 46 %}  However, an individual is not excluded from  the definition of disability on the basis of the illegal use of drugs if he or  she (1) has successfully completed a drug rehabilitation program or has  otherwise been successfully rehabilitated and is no longer engaging in drug  use, or (2) is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no  longer engaging in drug use.{% fn 47 %}

To be eligible, an individual with a disability must be &ldquo;qualified.&rdquo;   An individual with a disability is  qualified if he or she  meets the  essential eligibility requirements of a service, program, or activity, with or  without the provision of reasonable modifications, the provision of appropriate  auxiliary aids and services, or the removal of architectural and communication  barriers.{% fn 48 %}
{% enddetails %}

{% details 3. Who do Title II of the ADA and Section 504  protect in child welfare programs? expandable %}

**Answer:**  Title II of the ADA and Section 504  protect qualified individuals with disabilities, which can include children,  parents, legal guardians, relatives, other caretakers, foster and adoptive parents,  and individuals seeking to become foster or adoptive parents, from  discrimination by child welfare agencies and courts.{% fn 49 %}  Title II also protects individuals or  entities from being denied or excluded from child welfare services, programs or  activities because of association with an individual with a disability.{% fn 50 %}  For example, Title II prohibits a child  welfare agency from refusing to place a child with a prospective foster or  adoptive parent because the parent has a friend or relative with HIV.

Title II and Section 504 also protect &ldquo;companions&rdquo; of  individuals involved in the child welfare system when the companion is an  appropriate person with whom the child welfare agency or court should  communicate.  A companion may include any  family member, friend, or associate of a person seeking or receiving child  welfare services.{% fn 51 %}  For instance, when a child welfare agency  communicates with an individual&rsquo;s family member who is deaf, appropriate  auxiliary aids and services to the family member must be provided by the agency  to ensure effective communication.{% fn 52 %}

Finally, the ADA and Section 504 protect individuals from any retaliation  or coercion for exercising their right not to experience discrimination on the  basis of disability.  Individuals enjoy  this protection whether or not they have a disability.{% fn 53 %}
{% enddetails %}

### Who is required to  comply with the disability nondiscrimination laws?

{% details 4. What types of child welfare programs and activities are covered by  these laws? expandable %}

*All* activities of child welfare agencies are covered by Title II and Section 504, including removal proceedings and agencies&rsquo; programs and activities must not discriminate on the basis of disability.

**Answer**:  Title II covers *all* of the programs, services, and activities of state and local  governments, their agencies, and departments.{% fn 54 %}  Similarly, Section 504 applies to all of the  activities of agencies that receive Federal financial assistance.{% fn 55 %}  Therefore, all child welfare-related  activities and programs of child welfare agencies and courts are covered,  including, but not limited to, investigations, witness interviews, assessments,  removal of children from their homes, case planning and service planning,  visitation, guardianship, adoption, foster care, reunification services, and family  court proceedings.  Title II and Section  504 also make child welfare agencies responsible for the programs and  activities of private and non-profit agencies that provide services to children  and families on behalf of the state or municipality.{% fn 56 %}
{% enddetails %}

{% details 5. Do Title II and Section 504 apply to the  programs, services, and activities of family courts? expandable %}

**Answer**:  Yes.  State court proceedings, such as termination of parental rights  proceedings, are state activities and services for purposes of Title II.{% fn 57 %}  Section 504 also applies to state court  proceedings to the extent that court systems receive Federal financial  assistance.{% fn 58 %}

Title II and Section 504 require court proceedings to be  accessible to persons with disabilities, and persons with disabilities must  have an equal opportunity to participate in proceedings.{% fn 59 %}  For example, if a conference or hearing is  scheduled in a location that is inaccessible to wheelchair users, it should be  moved to an accessible location in order to ensure a wheelchair user can  participate fully in the conference or hearing.

Courts are required to provide auxiliary aids and services  when necessary to ensure effective communication, unless an undue burden or  fundamental alteration would result.{% fn 60 %}  For example, courts should provide appropriate  auxiliary aids and services to a parent who is deaf so that he or she can  access court proceedings as fully and effectively as those who are not deaf.

Like child welfare agencies, courts must also make reasonable  modifications to policies, practices, and procedures where necessary to avoid  discrimination on the basis of disability.{% fn 61 %}  For example, it may be necessary to adjust  hearing schedules to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities, if the  need for the adjustment is related to the individual&rsquo;s disability.  Or it may be necessary to provide an aide or  other assistive services in order for a person with a disability to participate  fully in a court event.{% fn 62 %}  Such assistance should be provided unless  doing so would result in a fundamental alteration.{% fn 63 %}
{% enddetails %}

{% details 6. Do Title II and Section 504 apply to private  contractors of child welfare agencies and courts? expandable %}

**Answer**:  Yes.   Title II prohibits discrimination in child welfare programs and services  when those services are provided by contractors.{% fn 64 %}  Section 504 prohibits discrimination in child  welfare programs receiving federal financial assistance, including programs  receiving federal financial assistance operated by private entities under  contract with child welfare agencies.{% fn 65 %}  Accordingly, to the extent that courts and  agencies contract with private agencies and providers to conduct child welfare  activities, the agencies should ensure that in the performance of their  contractual duties contractors comply with the prohibition of discrimination in  Title II and Section 504.{% fn 66 %}
{% enddetails %}

### What do the disability nondiscrimination laws require of child welfare  agencies and courts?

{% details 7. What is a reasonable modification? expandable %}

**Answer**:  Under Title II of the ADA and Section 504,  child welfare agencies and courts must make changes in policies, practices, and  procedures to accommodate the individual needs of a qualified person with a  disability, unless the change would result in a fundamental alteration to the  nature of the program.{% fn 67 %}  Parenting skills do not come naturally to many parents, with or without  disabilities.  To provide assistance to  parents with disabilities that is equal to that offered to parents without  disabilities, child welfare agencies may be required to provide enhanced or  supplemental training, to increase frequency of training opportunities, or to  provide such training in familiar environments conducive to learning.  For example, child welfare agencies may have  a parenting skills class once per week.   For a parent with a disability who requires individualized assistance in  learning new skills because of her or his disability, child welfare agencies  may need to modify this training to allow more frequent, longer, or more meaningful  training.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 8. What are auxiliary aids and services?  What does it mean to provide effective  communication? expandable %}

**Answer**:  Child welfare agencies and courts are  required to take appropriate steps – including the provision of appropriate  auxiliary aids and services – where necessary to ensure that individuals with  communication disabilities understand what is said or written and can  communicate as effectively as individuals without disabilities.{% fn 68 %}  Examples of auxiliary aids and services  include, among others, qualified interpreters, note takers, computer-aided  transcription services, accessible electronic and information technology,  written materials, telephone handset amplifiers, assistive listening devices,  assistive listening systems, telephones compatible with hearing aids, closed  caption decoders, open and closed captioning, telecommunications devices for  deaf persons (TDD&rsquo;s), videotext displays, qualified readers, taped texts, audio  recordings, braille materials, large print materials, and modifications to  existing devices.{% fn 69 %}

Child welfare agencies and courts should consider whether they  are taking appropriate steps to ensure that effective communication is provided  in different settings and as cases develop.   For example, a qualified interpreter may be necessary for smaller  settings involving only a few people, such as home visits or assessments,  whereas the use of real-time captioning may be appropriate during larger group  meetings, such as family team meetings or in court, where numerous people are  present or where the layout of the room makes it difficult to view an  interpreter and obtain visual cues from the speaker.

The type of auxiliary aid or service necessary to ensure  effective communication will vary in accordance with the method of  communication used by the individual with a disability; the nature, length, and  complexity of the communication involved; and the context in which the  communication is taking place.{% fn 70 %}  For example, a local child welfare agency may  be required to provide qualified interpreters to ensure effective communication  with individuals with disabilities during agency meetings to discuss service  planning.  However, to communicate a  simple message such as an appointment date or address, handwritten notes may be  sufficient.

Child welfare agencies must refrain from using minor children as interpreters except in limited exigent circumstances.  Adult companions may be used as interpreters only in emergencies and only when other factors are met.

State and local child welfare agencies and courts must give primary  consideration to the auxiliary aid or service requested by the individual.{% fn 71 %}  This means, for example, that if a parent  with a disability requests a qualified interpreter who is an oral  transliterator (a type of interpreter who facilitates spoken communication  between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and individuals who are  not), the agency must provide a qualified oral transliterator, unless the  agency can demonstrate that it would pose a fundamental alteration or an undue  administrative or financial burden and an alternative auxiliary aid or service  provides communication to the individual that is as effective as communication  provided to others.{% fn 72 %}  If provision of a particular auxiliary aid or  service would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service,  program, or activity, or if it would result in undue financial and  administrative burdens, a child welfare agency or court need not provide it.{% fn 73 %}  These entities must nonetheless provide  auxiliary aids or services that do not result in a fundamental alteration or  undue burdens that place the individual with a disability on equal footing with  individuals without disabilities to the maximum extent possible.

In order to be effective, auxiliary aids and services must be  provided in a timely manner and in such a way as to protect the privacy and  independence of the individual with a disability.{% fn 74 %}

Child welfare agencies and courts are prohibited from  requiring individuals with disabilities to supply their own interpreters or  other auxiliary aids and services.{% fn 75 %}  Child welfare agencies and courts may not  rely on minor children accompanying individuals with disabilities to interpret,  except in emergencies involving imminent threats to the safety or welfare of an  individual or the public where no interpreter is available.{% fn 76 %}

Child welfare agencies should consult with and include organizations that support and advocate for the rights of individuals with disabilities in their policy-making and training efforts.

Child welfare agencies and courts may rely on  adults accompanying individuals with disabilities to interpret, but only in  emergencies or where the individual with a disability specifically makes such a  request, the accompanying adult agrees to provide such assistance, and reliance  on that adult for such assistance is appropriate under the circumstances.{% fn 77 %}  State and local child welfare agencies and  courts are also prohibited from placing a surcharge on a particular individual  with a disability or any group of individuals with disabilities to cover the  costs of the provision of auxiliary aids or other services that are required to  provide that individual or group with nondiscriminatory treatment.{% fn 78 %}
{% enddetails %}

{% details 9. What steps are child welfare agencies required  to take to ensure that parents and prospective parents with disabilities  involved with the child welfare system have an equal opportunity to participate  in and benefit from their programs and activities? expandable %}

Title II and Section 504 require that agency staff refrain from basing assessments, services, or decisions on assumptions, generalizations, or stereotypes about disability.

**Answer**:  Child welfare agencies are required to ensure that  parents and prospective parents with disabilities involved in the child welfare  system are afforded an opportunity to preserve their families and/or to become  parents that is equal to the opportunity that the entities offer to individuals  without disabilities.{% fn 79 %}

Agencies should take steps to ensure, for example, that  investigators, social workers, supervisors, and others base their assessments  of and decisions regarding individuals with disabilities on actual facts that  pertain to the individual person, and not on assumptions, generalizations,  fears, or stereotypes about disabilities and how they might manifest.  The child welfare agency&rsquo;s obligation to  ensure individualized assessments applies at the outset and throughout any  involvement that an individual with a disability has with the child welfare  system.

Child welfare agencies should take steps to ensure that their obligations under Title II and Section 504 are met by reviewing the following:

- existing policies, practices, and procedures;
- how the agency actually processes cases;
- the agency&rsquo;s licensing and eligibility requirements for foster parents and guardians; and
- whether there are staff training or professional development needs.

Service plans for parents and prospective parents should address the  individual&rsquo;s disability-related needs and the auxiliary aids and services the agency  will provide to ensure equal opportunities.   At the same time, service plans should not rely on fears or stereotypes  to require parents with disabilities to accept unnecessary services or complete  unnecessary tasks to prove their fitness to parent when nondisabled parents  would not be required to do so.

Agencies also have an obligation to ensure that the aids,  benefits, and services provided to parents and prospective parents in support  of appropriate service plan activities and goals – such as visitation,  parenting skills training, transportation assistance, counseling, respite, and  other &ldquo;family preservation services&rdquo; and &ldquo;family support services&rdquo; – are  appropriately tailored to be useful to the individual.{% fn 80 %}  For example, if a child welfare  agency provides transportation to visits for individuals without disabilities,  it should provide accessible transportation to individuals with disabilities to  ensure equal opportunity.

To ensure that persons with disabilities have equal  opportunity to retain or reunify with their children, it may be necessary for  the agency to reasonably modify policies, practices, and procedures in child  welfare proceedings.  In general,  agencies should consider whether their existing policies, practices, and  procedures; their actual processing of cases; and their training materials comply  with the nondiscrimination requirements of Title II and Section 504 for  individuals with disabilities.  Agencies  should also take appropriate steps to ensure that components of child welfare  processing, such as &ldquo;fast-track&rdquo; and concurrent planning, are not applied to  persons with disabilities in a manner that has a discriminatory effect and that  denies parents with disabilities the opportunity to participate fully and  meaningfully in family reunification efforts.

In some instances, providing appropriate supports for persons  with disabilities means selecting an appropriate alternative already provided  in the Federal child welfare statutes.  For instance, section 475 of the Social  Security Act provides that the child welfare agency is required to file a  petition to terminate parental rights when the child is in foster care for the preceding  15 out of 22 months.  However, the law  provides exceptions to this requirement and gives child welfare agencies the  flexibility to work with parents who have a child in foster care beyond the 15  month period, including parents with disabilities.{% fn 81 %}  Exceptions to the termination of parental rights  requirement include situations where: (1) at the state&rsquo;s discretion, the child  is being cared for by a relative; (2) there is a compelling reason for  determining that filing the petition would not be in the best interests of the  child; or (3) the state, when reasonable efforts are to be made, has failed to  provide such services deemed necessary for the safe return of the child to his  or her home.{% fn 82 %} As to number (3), a child  welfare agency should provide the family of the child with the services  necessary for the safe return of the child to the child&rsquo;s home in a manner that  meets the unique needs of the family.   Failure to provide services, including services to address family members&rsquo;  disability-related needs, could qualify as an exception to the termination of  parental rights requirement.  Decisions  about whether this exception applies to a situation in which the supports necessary  for a person with a disability to access services were not provided should be  made on a case-by-case basis.

Given the responsibilities of agencies discussed above, we also  recommend that courts consider whether parents and prospective parents with disabilities  have been afforded an equal opportunity to attain reunification, including  whether they have been provided with appropriate services and supports and  other reasonable modifications to enable them to participate fully and  meaningfully in family preservation efforts.   Additionally, we suggest that courts consider whether any reasonable  modifications are necessary and should be made for parents with disabilities.  We also recommend that courts consider  evidence concerning the manner in which the use of adaptive equipment or  supportive services may enable a parent with disabilities to carry out the  responsibilities of parenting.

Foster care and adoption agencies must also ensure that  qualified foster parents and prospective parents with disabilities are provided  opportunities to participate in foster care and adoption programs equal to opportunities  that agencies provide to individuals without disabilities.{% fn 83 %}   This may require foster care and adoption  agencies to reasonably modify policies, practices, and procedures, where  necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.  For example, an adoption agency may be  required to provide large print and electronically accessible adoption  materials to accommodate the known needs of a visually impaired adoption  program applicant.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 10. When a child welfare agency or court provides or  requires an assessment of a parent during the processing of the child welfare  case, what do Title II and Section 504 require regarding the assessment? expandable %}

**Answer**:  Title II and Section 504 require that  assessments be individualized.{% fn 84 %}  An individualized assessment is a  fact-specific inquiry that evaluates the strengths, needs, and capabilities of  a particular person with disabilities based on objective evidence, personal  circumstances, demonstrated competencies, and other factors that are divorced  from generalizations and stereotypes regarding people with disabilities.  Child welfare agencies and courts may also be  required to provide reasonable modifications to their policies, practices, or procedures  and/or appropriate auxiliary aids and services during assessments to ensure  equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities.  For example, a child welfare agency or court may  be required to provide a qualified sign language interpreter to accommodate an  individual with a communication disability during an evaluation to ensure an  accurate assessment.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 11. How does the equal opportunity requirement apply  to case planning activities of child welfare agencies? expandable %}

**Answer**:  The equal opportunity requirement applies  throughout the continuum of a child welfare case, including case planning  activities.  In many instances, providing  the same services and resources to an individual with a disability that are  provided to individuals without disabilities will not be sufficient to provide  an equal opportunity to an individual with a disability.  Where this is the case, Title II and Section  504 may require agencies to provide additional, individually tailored services  and resources to meet the requirement to provide an equal opportunity to  participate in and benefit from the program.  For example, when providing training to  parents, agencies should consider the individual learning techniques of persons  with disabilities and may need to incorporate the use of visual modeling or  other individualized techniques to ensure equal opportunity to participate in  and benefit from the training.

Staff should consider whether the agency is appropriately  assisting family members in meeting service plan tasks and case goals, and  whether modifications must be made.  For  example, if parenting training is not working, staff should evaluate whether  there are any unnecessary barriers to the training that could be removed or reasonably  modified, such as increased opportunities for modeling behavior.  Agencies should also ensure that staff members  develop appropriate service plan tasks and goals that address the  individualized needs of all affected family members with disabilities, recognizing  that allowing parents with disabilities to use family members as part of their  support network may be appropriate.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 12. Is an agency required to arrange for services to  parents and prospective parents with disabilities that are necessary to avoid  discrimination but are not available within the agency&rsquo;s programs? expandable %}

Child welfare agencies may be required to modify their own services, or, when necessary, to arrange for services outside of the agency, in order to ensure equal opportunity for parents and prospective parents with disabilities under Title II and Section 504.

**Answer**:  In addition to providing to parents with  disabilities all reunification services that it provides to parents without  disabilities, a child welfare agency may be required, under Title II and  Section 504, to arrange for available services from sources outside of the  agency as a reasonable modification of its procedures and practices for parents  with disabilities so long as doing so would not constitute a fundamental  alteration.  Arranging for such services  from outside sources may be necessary to provide an equal opportunity to  participate in and benefit from the agency&rsquo;s programs.  Many specialized services to support persons  with disabilities are often available from other social service agencies, as  well as disability organizations.  For  example, for a person with a mental health disability, mental health services  and supports, such as supportive housing, peer supports, assertive community  treatment, and other community-based supports are often available from mental  health service agencies.  Child welfare  agencies should coordinate with such agencies and organizations to ensure that parents  and prospective parents with disabilities receive the most complete set of support  services possible, and also to ensure that reunification and other services are  specifically tailored to their needs.{% fn 85 %}  This requirement does not change an entity&rsquo;s  responsibility to make available those reunification services provided to  parents without disabilities or to reasonably modify them to provide equal  opportunity.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 13. Are child welfare agencies and courts permitted  to impose a surcharge on persons with disabilities for the provision of reasonable  modifications or auxiliary aids and services? expandable %}

**Answer**:  No.  Title II prohibits the imposition of  surcharges to cover the costs of measures required to provide an individual  with nondiscriminatory treatment.{% fn 86 %}  For example, child welfare agencies and  courts may not charge persons with disabilities for any costs associated with providing  effective communication during visitation, meetings, and court hearings, and  may be required to provide transportation to accessible facilities when needed  to fulfill their program access obligations.
{% enddetails %}

{% details 14. Child welfare agencies have an obligation to  ensure the health and safety of children.   How can agencies comply with the ADA and Section 504 while also ensuring  health and safety? expandable %}

**Answer**: Under child welfare law, child welfare agencies must make decisions to protect the safety of children.  The ADA and Section 504 are consistent with the principle of child safety.  For example, the ADA explicitly makes an exception where an individual with a disability represents a "direct threat."{% fn 87 %}   Section 504 incorporates a similar principle.{% fn 88 %}

Under the ADA and Section 504, a direct threat is a  significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by  a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of  auxiliary aids or services.{% fn 89 %}  In determining whether an individual poses a  direct threat to the health or safety of a child or others, child welfare  agencies and courts must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable  judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available  objective evidence, to ascertain the nature, duration, and severity of the risk  to the child; the probability that the potential injury to the child will  actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or  procedures will mitigate the risk.{% fn 90 %}

As such, in some cases an individual with a disability may not  be a qualified individual with a disability for child placement purposes.  What both the ADA and Section 504 require,  however, is that decisions about child safety and whether a parent, prospective  parent, or foster parent represents a direct threat to the safety of the child  must be based on an individualized assessment and objective facts and may not  be based on stereotypes or generalizations about persons with disabilities.{% fn 91 %}
{% enddetails %}

{% details 15. What are some other best practices for child  welfare agencies and courts? expandable %}

**Answer**:  We recommend that child welfare agencies and  courts review and update their policies and procedures on a regular basis to  ensure that they comply with the ADA and Section 504.  We recommend that child welfare agencies and  courts also ensure that their employees and contractors are sufficiently  trained in ADA and Section 504 compliance.   In addition, we recommend that they look for ways to coordinate with  disability organizations and agencies to assist in service planning and to  support them in their efforts to ensure equal opportunity for parents and prospective  parents with disabilities.
{% enddetails %}

### How can aggrieved persons file a  complaint?

{% details 16. What can individuals do when they believe they  have been subjected to discrimination in violation of Title II or Section 504? expandable %}
  
  **Answer:**  An aggrieved person may raise a Title II  or Section 504 claim in child welfare proceedings.  Additionally, subject to certain limitations,  an aggrieved person may pursue a complaint regarding discrimination in child  welfare services, programs, or activities under Title II or Section 504 in  federal court.{% fn 92 %}
  
  Aggrieved individuals may also file  complaints with HHS and DOJ.  HHS and DOJ  also have authority to initiate compliance review investigations of child  welfare agencies and courts with or without receiving a complaint.  If an investigation of a complaint or a  compliance review reveals a violation, HHS or DOJ may issue letters of findings  and initiate resolution efforts.{% fn 93 %}  DOJ may initiate litigation when it finds  that a child welfare agency or court is not in compliance with  Title II.  HHS may also refer cases to  DOJ for litigation where a violation is found and is not voluntarily resolved.{% fn 94 %}
  
  Title II and Section 504 allow for  declaratory and injunctive relief, such as an order from a court finding a  violation and requiring the provision of reasonable modifications.  Title II and Section 504 also allow for  compensatory damages for aggrieved individuals.   Individuals who prevail as parties in litigation may also obtain  reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees, costs, and litigation expenses.{% fn 95 %}
  
  Under Section 504, remedies also  include suspension and termination of Federal financial assistance, the use of  cautionary language or attachment of special conditions when awarding Federal  financial assistance, and bypassing recalcitrant agencies and providing Federal  financial assistance directly to sub-recipients.{% fn 96 %}
{% enddetails %}
