  The opioid crisis poses an extraordinary challenge to communities throughout our country. The Department of Justice (the Department) has responded with a comprehensive approach prioritizing prevention, enforcement, and treatment. This includes enforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination against people in recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) who are not engaging in illegal drug use, including those who are taking legally-prescribed medication to treat their OUD. This guidance document provides information about how the ADA can protect individuals with OUD from discrimination—an important part of combating the opioid epidemic across American communities. While this document focuses on individuals with OUD, the legal principles discussed also apply to individuals with other types of substance use disorders.

## 1) What is the ADA? 

The ADA is a federal law that gives civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in many
areas of life. The ADA guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as
everyone else to enjoy employment opportunities,{% fn 1 %} participate in state and local government
programs,{% fn 2 %} and purchase goods and services.{% fn 3 %} For example, the ADA protects people with
disabilities from discrimination by social services agencies; child welfare agencies; courts;
prisons and jails; medical facilities, including hospitals, doctors’ offices, and skilled nursing
facilities; homeless shelters; and schools, colleges, and universities.  

## 2) Does an individual in treatment or recovery from opioid use disorder have a disability under the ADA?  

Typically, yes, unless the individual is currently engaged in illegal drug use. <em>See</em> Question 5.  

The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.{% fn 4%} The ADA defines disability as (1) a
physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, including major bodily functions; (2) a record of such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such an impairment.{% fn 5 %}  

People with OUD typically have a disability because they have a drug addiction that
substantially limits one or more of their major life activities. Drug addiction is considered a
physical or mental impairment under the ADA.{% fn 6 %}  Drug addiction occurs when the repeated use
of drugs causes clinically significant impairment, such as health problems and or an inability to
meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home.{% fn 7 %} People with OUD may therefore
experience a substantial limitation of one or more major life activities, such as caring for
oneself, learning, concentrating, thinking, communicating, working, or the operation of major
bodily functions, including neurological and brain functions.{% fn 8 %} The ADA also protects individuals
who are in recovery, but who would be limited in a major life activity in the absence of treatment and/or services to support recovery.{% fn 9 %}  

{% include expand-accordions-wrapper.html expand-heading="3) Does the ADA protect individuals who are taking legally prescribed medication to treat their opioid use disorder?" %}

Yes, if the individual is not engaged in the illegal use of drugs. Under the ADA, an individual’s
use of prescribed medication, such as that used to treat OUD, is not an “illegal use of drugs” if
the individual uses the medication under the supervision of a licensed health care professional,
including primary care or other non-specialty providers.{% fn 10 %} This includes medications for opioid
use disorder (MOUD) or medication assisted treatment (MAT). MOUD is the use of one of
three medications (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for treatment of OUD;{% fn 11 %} MAT refers to treatment of OUD and certain
other substance use disorders by combining counseling and behavioral therapies with the use
of FDA-approved medications.{% fn 12 %}  

{% accordion expandable %}
{% collapsible %}
### Example A
A skilled nursing facility refuses to admit a patient with OUD because the patient takes
doctor-prescribed MOUD, and the facility prohibits any of its patients from taking MOUD.
The facility’s exclusion of patients based on their OUD would violate the ADA.
{% endcollapsible %}

{% collapsible %}
### Example B
A jail does not allow incoming inmates to continue taking MOUD prescribed before their
detention. The jail’s blanket policy prohibiting the use of MOUD would violate the ADA.
{% endcollapsible %}
{% endaccordion %}

## 4) Does the ADA protect individuals with opioid use disorder who currently participate in a drug treatment program?

Yes. Individuals whose OUD is a disability and who are participating in a supervised
rehabilitation or drug treatment program are protected by the ADA if they are not currently
engaging in the illegal use of drugs.{% fn 13 %} <em>See</em> explanation in Question 5. It is illegal to discriminate
against these individuals based on their treatment for OUD.  

{% accordion expandable %}
{% collapsible %}
### Example C  
A doctor’s office has a blanket policy of denying care to patients receiving treatment for
OUD. The office would violate the ADA if it excludes individuals based on their OUD.  
{% endcollapsible %}  

{% collapsible %}  
### Example D  
A town refuses to allow a treatment center for people with OUD to open after residents
complained that they did not want “those kind of people” in their area. The town may
violate the ADA if its refusal is because of the residents’ hostility towards people with OUD.  
{% endcollapsible %}  
{% endaccordion %}

## 5) Does the ADA protect individuals who are currently illegally using opioids? 

Generally, no. With limited exceptions, the ADA does not protect individuals engaged in the
current illegal use of drugs if an entity takes action against them because of that illegal drug
use.{% fn 14 %} “Current illegal use of drugs” means illegal use of drugs that occurred recently enough to
justify a reasonable belief that a person’s drug use is current or that continuing use is a real and
ongoing problem.{% fn 15 %} Illegal use, however, does not include taking a medication, including an
opioid or medication used to treat OUD, under the supervision of a licensed health care
professional.{% fn 16 %}  

{% accordion expandable %}
{% collapsible %}
### Example E
A mentoring program requires its volunteers to provide test results showing that they do not
engage in the illegal use of drugs. The program dismisses a volunteer who tests positive for
opioids for which the volunteer does not have a valid prescription. This does not violate the
ADA because the dismissal was based on current illegal drug use.  
{% endcollapsible %}

In addition, an individual cannot be denied health services, or services provided in connection
with drug rehabilitation, on the basis of that individual’s current illegal use of drugs, if the
individual is otherwise entitled to such services.{% fn 17 %} But a drug rehabilitation or treatment
program may deny participation to individuals who engage in illegal use of drugs while they are
in the program.{% fn 18 %} 

{% collapsible %}
### Example F
A hospital emergency room routinely turns away people experiencing drug overdoses, but
admits all other patients who are experiencing emergency health issues. The hospital would
be in violation of the ADA for denying health services to those individuals because of their
current illegal drug use, since those individuals would otherwise be entitled to emergency
services.
{% endcollapsible %}

{% collapsible %}
### Example G
A drug rehabilitation program asks a participant to leave because that participant routinely
breaks a rule prohibiting the use of illegal drugs while in the program. This is not
discrimination under the ADA because the program can require participants to abstain from
illegal drugs while in the program.
{% endcollapsible %}
{% endaccordion %}

## 6) Does the ADA protect individuals with a history of past opioid use disorder, who no longer illegally use drugs?

Yes. The ADA protects individuals with a “record of” disability. As explained above in Question
2, OUD typically qualifies as a disability. Therefore, individuals with a “record of” having OUD
usually will be protected under the ADA.{% fn 19 %}

Individuals would fall into this category if they have a history of, or have been misclassified as having, OUD.{% fn 20 %}
{% accordion expandable %}
{% collapsible %}
### Example H
A city terminates an employee based on his disclosure that he completed treatment for a
previous addiction to prescription opioids. The city may be in violation of the ADA for
discriminating against the employee based on his record of OUD.
{% endcollapsible %}
{% endaccordion %}

## 7) Does the ADA provide any legal protections for individuals who are regarded as having an opioid use disorder, whether or not they actually have an opioid use disorder?

Yes. The ADA protects individuals who are “regarded as” having OUD, even if they do not in
fact have OUD.{% fn 21 %}  

{% accordion expandable %}
{% collapsible %}
### Example I
An employer mistakenly believes that an employee has OUD simply because that employee
uses opioids legally prescribed by her physician to treat pain associated with an injury. The
ADA prohibits an employer from firing the employee based on this mistaken belief.  
{% endcollapsible %}
{% endaccordion %}

## 8) Does the ADA protect individuals from discrimination based on their association with individuals who have opioid use disorder?  
Yes. The ADA protects individuals from discrimination based on their known association or
relationship with an individual who has a disability, such as a friend, coworker, or family
member. The ADA also protects organizations, such as OUD treatment clinics, from
discriminatory enforcement of zoning rules based on the organization’s known association with
or relationship to individuals with OUD.{% fn 22 %}

## 9) Can employers have a drug policy or conduct drug testing for opioids?  
Yes. Employers may adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures, including drug
testing, designed to ensure that individuals are not engaging in the illegal use of drugs.{% fn 23 %}
However, some individuals who test positive for an opioid, which may include MOUD, will be
able to show that the medication is being taken as prescribed or administered and a licensed
health care professional is supervising its use. These individuals may not be denied, or fired
from, a job for this legal use of medication, unless they cannot do the job safely and effectively,
or are disqualified under another federal law.{% fn 24 %}  

## 10) What can I do if I believe I have been discriminated against because of my opioid use disorder or treatment for my opioid use disorder?
Individuals may file a complaint with the Department of Justice if they believe that a public
accommodation or a state or local government is discriminating or has discriminated against
them because of OUD. Individuals may also bring private lawsuits under the ADA.  

Information about filing an ADA complaint with the Department is available
at [civilrights.justice.gov](https://civilrights.justice.gov). More information about the ADA is available by calling the
Department’s toll-free ADA information line at 800-514-0301 or 800-514-0383 (TTY), or
accessing its ADA website at [ADA.gov]({{'/index' | relative_url}}).  

Complaints about a state or local government’s programs, services, or activities relating to the
provision of health care and social services can also be filed with the Department of Health and
Human Services Office for Civil Rights (HHS OCR). Information about filing an HHS OCR
complaint is available at [hhs.gov/civil-rights/filing-a-complaint](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/filing-a-complaint), by email at [OCRMail@hhs.gov](mailto:OCRMail@hhs.gov), by phone at 1-800-368-1019, or at 1-800-537-7697 (TTY).  

Complaints about employment discrimination (called “charges”) on the basis of disability can be
filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Information about filing an
EEOC charge is available at [eeoc.gov](https://www.eeoc.gov) or 800-669-4000, 800-669-6820 (TTY), or 844-234-5122
(ASL Video Phone). Additional EEOC resources regarding employees and opioid use are
available at [eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/use-codeine-oxycodone-and-other-opioids-informationemployees](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/use-codeine-oxycodone-and-other-opioids-informationemployees) and [eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/how-health-care-providers-can-help-current-andformer-patients-who-have-used-opioids](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/how-health-care-providers-can-help-current-andformer-patients-who-have-used-opioids).  

Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against under the ADA and would like to
file a complaint should file as soon as possible. For instance, there are specific filing deadlines
for a charge of employment discrimination, either 180 days or 300 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, depending on the jurisdiction where the charge is filed.  

## 11) Where can I find treatment for opioid use disorder?  
Information about treatment for opioid use disorder is available at [hhs.gov/opioids](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids), [findtreatment.gov](https://www.findtreatment.gov), [samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/practitioner-programdata/treatment-practitioner-locator](https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/practitioner-program-data/treatment-practitioner-locator), and [dpt2.samhsa.gov/treatment](https://www.dpt2.samhsa.gov/treatment).
