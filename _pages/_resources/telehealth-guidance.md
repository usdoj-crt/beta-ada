Telehealth is an increasingly important way of delivering health care. Many health care
providers and patients have turned to telehealth during the COVID-19 public health
emergency to reduce community spread of the virus, and it is now a more accepted way
to provide and receive health care services. The U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are committed to ensuring that
health care providers who use telehealth, including telehealth that is available 24/7, do
so in a nondiscriminatory manner.

With this guidance, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and DOJ’s Civil Rights Division
(CRT) explain how various federal laws require making telehealth accessible to people
with disabilities and limited English proficient persons. These laws include Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504),{% fn 1 %} the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA),{% fn 2 %} Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI),{% fn 3 %} and Section 1557 of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Section 1557),{% fn 4 %} (collectively, “federal civil rights
laws”). Section 1557 regulations specifically provide that covered health programs or activities provided by covered entities through electronic or information technology must be accessible to individuals with disabilities unless doing so would result in undue financial and administrative burdens or fundamental alteration of the health program.{% fn 5 %}

This guidance builds on work that HHS and DOJ have previously done to promote
nondiscrimination and access in health care. For example, HHS has developed a website
for consumers and providers of telehealth that promotes access to patients, including
those who face barriers accessing technology.{% fn 6 %}

The website has a health equity section that includes practical tips about how to improve access to telehealth, including making materials accessible in different formats and multiple languages and using assistive
devices.

In addition, the HHS Health Resources and Services Administration{% fn 7 %} has an Office for Telehealth Advancement dedicated to expanding access to telehealth and promoting health outcomes, including funding the Telehealth Resource Center and providing grants to promote the equitable use of telehealth.{% fn 8 %}  OCR has issued guidance on use of telehealth{% fn 9 %} and audio telehealth{% fn 10 %} in keeping with HIPAA requirements. OCR has also issued extensive guidance on non-discriminatory access to health care based on disability, race, color, national origin, sex, and age{% fn 11 %} including during the COVID-19
pandemic.{% fn 12 %}

CRT has created resources describing the need for health care providers, among others,
to communicate effectively with people with disabilities.{% fn 13 %} In light of the COVID-19
pandemic, CRT issued a statement reiterating the obligations of health care providers to
ensure equal access for people with disabilities and avoid disability discrimination.{% fn 14 %} In
addition, CRT operates a Barrier-Free Health Care Initiative in conjunction with U.S.
Attorneys’ offices across the nation, which targets enforcement efforts to promote
nondiscrimination in health care.{% fn 15 %}

The Resources section at the end includes additional information about telehealth, civil
rights protections, and helpful tools for providers to understand their obligations and
for patients to understand their rights in this area. All entities subject to Section 504,
the ADA, Title VI, and Section 1557 should review their telehealth systems, policies, and
processes, to ensure accessibility of their telehealth programs for all persons with
disabilities and limited English proficient persons.

## Telehealth and Civil Rights Protections

Telehealth takes many forms, including communication between a health care provider
and a patient using video, phone, or other electronic means. In addition to being used
for remote health care appointments, telehealth is used in various other ways, for example by allowing patients to send information to health care providers for review and analysis, and by providers to monitor a patient’s health remotely.

Although telehealth has many advantages, accessing care via telehealth may present
challenges for certain populations. Sometimes these challenges, if not addressed, may
result in these populations facing barriers and issues accessing this care. Some
examples may include:

- A person who is blind or has limited vision may find that the web-based platform
their doctor uses for telehealth appointments does not support screen reader
software.
- A person who is deaf and communicates with a sign language interpreter may
find that the video conferencing program their provider uses does not allow an
interpreter to join the appointment from a separate location.
- A limited English proficient (LEP) person may need instructions in a language
other than English about how to set up a telehealth appointment.{% fn 16 %}

A health care provider’s failure to take appropriate action to ensure that care provided
through telehealth is accessible can result in unlawful discrimination.{% fn 17 %} Below, this
guidance outlines steps that providers may, and in some cases must, take to help ensure
accessible services to all individuals.

The federal civil rights laws discussed in this guidance prohibit discrimination on the
basis of disability, race, color, and national origin, among other bases. The following
discussion includes a non-exhaustive list of examples of how these nondiscrimination
protections apply in the telehealth context.

### A. Protections against Discrimination for People with Disabilities

**Disability Nondiscrimination:** Federal law provides a general rule that no qualified
individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation
in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a covered entity, or
otherwise be subjected to discrimination by a covered entity.{% fn 18 %}

For example:

A health care provider who offers telehealth services violates the law by adopting
a blanket policy of refusing to schedule telehealth appointments for any patients
with intellectual disabilities because the provider wrongly assumes that these
patients would have a hard time understanding how to navigate the online
platform used for telehealth appointments. The provider must offer these
patients an opportunity to participate in telehealth appointments equal to that
given to others.{% fn 19 %}

**Reasonable Modifications for People with Disabilities.** Health care providers must
make reasonable changes to their policies, practices, or procedures, which may include
providing additional support to patients when needed before, during, and after a virtual
visit, to avoid discriminating on the basis of disability.{% fn 20 %}

*Examples of reasonable modifications that may need to be provided:*

- A physician’s office may need to offer additional time in advance of an
appointment, to give a patient with an intellectual disability a chance to become
familiar with the features of the telehealth platform. During the visit, the provider
should speak directly to the patient about their care, taking additional time as
needed to ensure that the person understands what is being asked. The provider should also use a platform that allows a support person to be present with the patient or log in from a third location.
- A dermatology practice that typically limits telehealth appointments to 30
minutes may need to schedule a longer appointment for a patient who needs
additional time to communicate because of their disability.
- A doctor’s office that does not allow anyone but the patient to attend telehealth
appointments would have to make reasonable changes to that policy to allow a
person with a disability to bring a support person and/or family member to the
appointment where needed to meaningfully access the health care appointment.

**Effective Communication with People with Disabilities.** Providers must communicate
effectively with people who have communication disabilities (including certain
disabilities affecting speech or motor function) when providing care in person or
through telehealth.{% fn 21 %} This requirement applies to all communications, including about
provider availability, records access, scheduling, and during appointments.{% fn 22 %} Health care
providers must provide communication aids and services when needed and at no cost
to the patient.{% fn 23 %}

Because communication needs can differ depending on the individual and their
situation, effective solutions will differ too. The aids or services that are effective for the
individual and convey accurate information between provider and patient may depend
on the nature, length, complexity, and context of the communications and providers
working with the patient to best determine what works for the patient.{% fn 24 %}

*Examples of when communication aids and services may need to be provided, include but are not limited to:*

***For people who are deaf or hard of hearing:***

- A physical therapy practice that uses telehealth to provide remote training
sessions to patients may need to provide a sign language interpreter who is
qualified to interpret physical therapy instructions and techniques, including
using any necessary specialized vocabulary, for a patient who is deaf.{% fn 25 %} When an
interpreter is necessary, the provider will need to make sure that their telehealth
platform allows the interpreter to join the session.{% fn 26 %} The provider may not
require patients to bring their own interpreter.{% fn 27 %}
- A mental health provider who uses telehealth to provide remote counseling to
individuals may need to ensure that the telehealth platform it uses can support
effective real-time captioning for a patient who is hard of hearing. The provider
may not require patients to bring their own real-time captioner.{% fn 28 %}

***For people who are blind or have visual disabilities:***

- A dietician who uses a web-based platform to send written dietary
recommendations to their patients may need to make sure the recommendations
are screen-reader compatible for a patient who is blind.
- A sports medicine practice that uses videos to show patients how to do physical
therapy exercises may need to make sure that the videos have audio descriptions
for patients with visual disabilities.
- A urologist who provides remote consultations through a video platform may
need to provide a consultation by phone for a patient who requests that option
due to a visual disability.

### B. Protections Against Discrimination for Limited English Proficient Persons

**Race, Color, and National Origin Nondiscrimination:** Federal law provides that no
person shall, on the basis of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs, or activities receiving federal financial assistance, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.{% fn 29 %} The national origin protections prohibit discrimination against LEP persons.{% fn 30 %}

**Meaningful Access for LEP Persons.** Recipients of federal financial assistance must take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access for LEP persons{% fn 31 %} in all aspects of care, including telehealth services. This can include, but is not limited to, providing meaningful access regarding information about the availability of telehealth services, the process for scheduling telehealth appointments, and the appointment itself.

In many instances, language assistance services are necessary to provide meaningful
access. As noted in both HHS and DOJ LEP guidance, language assistance services can
include, but are not limited to, oral language assistance, performed by a qualified,
competent interpreter or in-language communication with a bilingual employee; and written translation of documents, performed by a qualified, competent translator.{% fn 32 %}  When language assistance services are necessary to provide meaningful access, a recipient of federal financial assistance should clarify that any language assistance service offered is free to the LEP person.{% fn 33 %}

Examples of language assistance services include, but are not limited to:

- In emails to patients or social media postings about the opportunity to schedule
telehealth appointments, a federally assisted health care provider includes a short
non-English statement that explains to LEP persons how to obtain, in a language
they understand, the information contained in the email or social media posting.
- When selecting a telehealth platform, a federally assisted health care provider
takes reasonable steps to ensure that the telehealth platform can support the
inclusion of a telephone interpreter or video remote interpreter as part of the call
in order to provide meaningful access to the appointment for LEP patients.
- An OBGYN who receives federal financial assistance and legally provides
reproductive health services, using telehealth to provide remote appointments to
patients, provides a qualified language interpreter for an LEP patient. The
provider makes sure that their telehealth platform allows the interpreter to join
the session. Due to issues of confidentiality and potential conflicts of interest
(such as in matters involving domestic violence) providers should avoid relying
on patients to bring their own interpreter.{% fn 34 %}

{% details Special Note for Health care Providers Covered by the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules %}
HHS OCR supports covered health care providers’ use of non-public facing audio and
video communication technologies to provide telehealth during the COVID-19 public
health emergency. In March 2020, OCR issued a Notification of Enforcement Discretion
for Telehealth Remote Communications providing that OCR will not impose penalties
against covered health care providers for non-compliance with the HIPAA Privacy,
Security, and Breach Notification Rules in connection with the good faith provision of
telehealth during the COVID–19 public health emergency. This exercise of discretion
applies to telehealth provided for any reason, regardless of whether the telehealth
service is related to the diagnosis and treatment of health conditions related to COVID–19. OCR identified examples of non-public facing communication products that could
be used to provide telehealth, and some best practices to ensure the continued privacy
and security of individuals’ protected health information. OCR also issued guidance in
the form of frequently asked questions to clarify how OCR is applying enforcement
discretion to support the good faith provision of telehealth and guidance on using
remote communication technologies for audio-only telehealth that also applies when
the Notification of Enforcement Discretion is no longer in effect.
{% enddetails %}

## Filing a Complaint

- If you believe that a telehealth provider has violated your or another person’s civil
rights or health information privacy rights, you may file a complaint with HHS at:
[https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints/index.html).
- If you believe that a telehealth provider has violated your or another person’s civil
rights, you may also file a complaint with the Department of Justice at:
[https://civilrights.justice.gov/report/](https://civilrights.justice.gov/report/).

*Both OCR and CRT share civil rights jurisdiction in some instances and work collaboratively to ensure complaints are addressed by the appropriate office.*

566-69; DOJ LEP Guidance to Recipients, 67 Fed. Reg. at 41,459 (“Recipients are required to take reasonable steps
to ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by LEP persons.”). As the June 2002 DOJ guidance
explains, “Under DOJ regulations implementing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, et seq.
(Title VI), recipients of Federal financial assistance have a responsibility to ensure meaningful access to their
programs and activities by persons with limited English proficiency (LEP).” 67 Fed. Reg. at 41,455 (citing 28
C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(2)). To determine the extent to which language access services need to be provided, DOJ’s 2002
guidance outlines a four-factor individualized assessment. 67 Fed. Reg. at 41,459. The June 2002 DOJ guidance’s
intent is “to suggest a balance that ensures meaningful access by LEP persons to critical services while not imposing undue burdens” on smaller entities.” *Id.*

recipients should generally offer competent interpreter services free of cost to the LEP person); HHS LEP Guidance
to Recipients, 68 Fed. Reg. at 47,320 (describing how “it may be important for the recipient [of federal financial

DOJ LEP Guidance to Recipients, 67 Fed. Reg. at 41,462 (explaining that LEP persons should be permitted “to
use, at their own expense, an interpreter of their own choosing … in place of or as a supplement to the free language services expressly offered by the recipient” but that special care should be taken because “[i]n many circumstances, family members (especially children), friends, other inmates or other detainees are not competent to provide quality and accurate interpretations. Issues of confidentiality, privacy, or conflict of interest may also arise. LEP individuals may feel uncomfortable revealing or describing sensitive, confidential, or potentially embarrassing medical, law enforcement (*e.g.*, sexual or violent assaults), family, or financial information to a family member, friend, or member of the local community.”); HHS LEP Guidance to Recipients, 68 Fed. Reg. at 47,318 (“[T]he recipient may need to consider issues of competence, appropriateness, conflicts of interest, and confidentiality in determining whether it should respect the desire of the LEP person to use an interpreter of his or her own choosing.”)
