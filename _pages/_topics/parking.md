## Features

### Location

In parking lots or garages, accessible parking spaces must be located on the shortest accessible route to the accessible entrance. An accessible route is the path a person with a disability takes to enter and move through a building or facility.

### Access Aisles

Accessible parking spaces must have access aisles. Access aisles provide a designated area for people who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices to get in and out of their car or van. Mobility devices allow people with disabilities to move about independently. They include walkers, canes, crutches, braces, manual or power wheelchairs, Segways, and electric scooters.

#### Access aisles must be:

{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}Marked (to discourage drivers from parking in them){% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}The same length as the space{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Level with the parking space{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

{% asset project-images/aisle-parking.png alt="A van-accessible parking space sharing an access aisle with an accessible parking space for a car" %}

Two accessible parking spaces can share an access aisle with the access aisle
between the two parking spaces (except in angled parking).

An access aisle can be placed on either side of the parking space (except in angled parking where it must be located on the passenger side of the parking space).

### Parking Spaces

Accessible parking spaces must be provided for cars and vans.

#### Car accessible spaces must:

{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}Be at least 96 inches wide{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Have an access aisle at least 60 inches wide{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Have no more than a 1.48 (2.08%) slope in all directions{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}Have a surface that is firm, stable, and slip-resistant{% endlist_item %}
{% list_item %}
Have a sign with the international symbol of accessibility on it, mounted at least 60 inches above the ground (measured to the bottom of the sign)
{% endlist_item %}
{% endlist %}

{% asset project-images/car-accessible.png alt="Accessible parking spaces with 60-inch minimum width access aisle for cars" %}

## Calculating Accessible Parking Spaces

The number of accessible parking spaces must be considered separately for each parking structure (lot or garage), not based on the total number of parking spaces provided on a site.

The chart below shows the number of accessible spaces required by the [2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design]({{'/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds#parking-spaces' | relative_url}}).

<table class="usa-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
