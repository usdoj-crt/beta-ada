{% details More about what undue burden means %}

An undue burden is a significant difficulty or expense. Whether an undue burden

exists varies from business to business—or state/local government to state/local

government— and sometimes from one year to the next.

For example, it might be an undue burden for a small retail store to provide a

sign language interpreter without notice for a routine transaction. But the store

may be able to use paper and pen to write back and forth to complete the

transaction.
