  Some people with disabilities use mobility devices to get around, such as walkers, wheelchairs, or other power-driven devices. People with disabilities may use a variety of mobility devices based on their needs.

  In the ADA, these mobility devices fall into two main categories:
  1. Wheelchairs (manual or power-driven) and manually powered devices
  2. Other power-driven mobility devices (OPDMDs)

## Basic Requirements

**State/local governments and businesses** must allow a person with a disability who uses a _wheelchair or other manually powered mobility aid_ into all areas where members of the public are allowed to go.

**A person with a disability** who uses an OPDMD must be allowed to enter businesses and government facilities unless it can be shown that a particular type of device cannot be safely used.

## Wheelchairs and Manually Powered Devices

Wheelchairs are manually operated or power-driven devices designed primarily for people with disabilities to get around.

Manually powered devices also include:

- Walkers
- Canes
- Crutches
- Braces

## Other Power-Driven Mobility Devices

An “other power-driven mobility device” (OPDMD) is any mobility device powered by batteries, fuel, or other engines that may be used by people with disabilities to get around. OPDMDs include:

- Golf carts
- Electronic personal assistance mobility devices (EPAMDs) such as Segways®
- Other devices designed to operate in areas without defined public routes, such as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs)

### Factors to Consider

Businesses and government facilities must consider the following factors when deciding whether an OPDMD can be used:

- Type, size, weight, dimensions and speed of the device
- Pedestrian traffic in the facility
- Design and operational characteristics of the facility, which can include:
  - Indoor or outdoor facility
  - Square footage
  - Furniture placement and density
  - OPDMD storage availability
- _Legitimate safety requirements_ for operating the OPDMD
- Risk of serious harm to environmental, natural, or cultural resources
- Conflicts with federal land management requirements

{% details More about <em>legitimate safety requirements</em> %}
Businesses and governments can impose legitimate safety requirements for operating the OPDMD within a facility.

For example, a cruise ship may decide that people with disabilities using Segways®  can generally be accommodated, except in constricted areas, such as passageways to cabins that are very narrow and have low ceilings.

Safety requirements must be based on actual risks, not on speculation or stereotypes about a particular type of device or how it might be operated by people with disabilities using them.

{% enddetails %}

After considering these factors, an agency or business might establish a policy that:

- Requires users to operate devices at the speed of pedestrian traffic
- Identifies locations where devices cannot go
- Provides instructions for going through security screening (if necessary)
- Indicates if storage is available for the device

## Asking Someone About Their Mobility Device

If a person with a disability enters a business or government facility using an OPDMD:

{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}
You may ask that they provide “credible assurance” that the device is used because of a disability.

You must accept any of these types of credible assurance:

- A valid, state-issued disability parking placard
- Other state-issued proof of disability
- A statement from the person that the OPDMD is used because of a disability, unless the person is observed doing something that contradicts this statement
  {% endlist_item %}
  {% list_item cancel %}
  You may not ask about the nature or extent of someone’s disability. This is also true if someone is using a wheelchair or other manual mobility aid.
  {% endlist_item %}
  {% endlist %}
