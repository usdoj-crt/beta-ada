# beta-ada

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby-based static site generator and is built with the [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov), a set of reusable, high-quality components for modern websites. Additionally, this site is optimized for deployment on 18F's [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov) publishing service.

## Getting Started

### Installation for development
    $ git clone https://github.com/usdoj-crt/beta-ada
    $ cd beta-ada

### Running the application

This site requires Ruby and Node.js in order to run locally. For guidance on installing the project's requirements, please see the [Local development environment](https://github.com/usdoj-crt/beta-ada/wiki/Local-development-environment) wiki page.

#### With locally installed `node` and `ruby`
    $ npm install
    $ bundle install
    $ npm start
    OR
    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

To build but not serve the site, run `npm run build` or `bundle exec jekyll build`.

#### With Docker
    $ docker-compose run node npm install
    $ docker-compose build
    $ docker-compose up

To build but not serve the site, run:
```
docker-compose run ruby bundle exec jekyll build
```

Note that when built by Federalist, `npm run federalist` is used instead of
`npm run build`.

Open your web browser to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to view your
site.

### Testing

#### With locally installed `node` and `ruby`
    $ npm test

#### With Docker
    $ docker-compose run node npm test

## Technologies you should familiarize yourself with

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) - The primary site engine that builds your code and content.
- [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter) - The top of each page/post includes keywords within `--` tags. This is meta data that helps Jekyll build the site, but you can also use it to pass custom variables.
- [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov)
